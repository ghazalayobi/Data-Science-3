Heard took the witness stand in a Virginia court on Wednesday afternoon during Deppâ€™s defamation lawsuit against her â€“ a make-or-break moment for the actors in a four-week trial that had so far largely focused on Deppâ€™s version of events during their turbulent 15-month marriage. She described how during a weekend away with friends in May 2013, Depp tore her dress, ripped off her underwear and stuck his fingers â€œinsideâ€<9d> her. â€œHe proceeds to do a cavity search,â€<9d> she said. â€œHeâ€™s looking for his drugs, his cocaine.â€<9d> Earlier in the hearing, the psychologist Dawn Hughes testified that Heard told her Depp had put his fingers up her vagina to search for cocaine. At one point in their relationship, Heard also alleged during her witness statement that Depp held her by the neck and warned he could â€œkill meâ€<9d>. Speaking at the hearing, she said: â€œI struggle to find the words to describe how painful this is â€¦ this is horrible for me to sit here for weeks and relive everything, to hear people that I knew, some well, some not, my ex-husband with whom I shared a life, speak about our lives in the way they have.â€<9d> She added: â€œThis has been one of the most painful and difficult things Iâ€™ve ever gone through, for sure.â€<9d> Heard described typical activities from her upbringing in Texas, ranging from breaking in horses to working at her fatherâ€™s construction company, where she answered phones, then working at a modelling agency, where she earned enough to have professional photographs taken, and her move to Hollywood. â€œI went from slightly bigger role to slightly bigger role, and worked my butt off,â€<9d> Heard said. She had met Depp when she auditioned for Bruce Robinsonâ€™s The Rum Diary. â€œI was the dream kid, thatâ€™s what he told me,â€<9d> Heard testified. During filming in Puerto Rico in 2011, the actors were scripted to kiss. â€œIt didnâ€™t feel like a normal scene in the job, the lines were blurred. He grabbed my face and pulled me in and really kissed me.â€<9d> Heard was asked if he used his tongue. â€œYes,â€<9d> she said. In her trailer, she said, â€œhe kind of picked up the back of my robe with his boot and I kind of turned around and giggled â€¦ He kind of playfully pushed me down on this bed, sofa. Playful and flirtatious. â€œAnd he said, â€˜Yum.â€™ And kind of lifted his eyebrows up like that.â€<9d> Deppâ€™s seduction continued, she said, with Heard â€œbatting him awayâ€<9d>. After the filming was complete, she said, they parted. â€œWe were both in relationships. It was intimidating, and we went our separate ways.â€<9d> Months later, she said, Depp called her out of the blue and invited Heard to his house in Beverly Hills, ostensibly to have a drink with him and Robinson. â€œIt was clearly not about the movie, if you know what I mean,â€<9d> she said. Depp, she said sent her a dress he described as wrapping paper â€“ â€œhappy wrappingâ€<9d>, he wrote. He sent guitars and other gifts. Finally, on the Rum Diary press tour in London, they slept together, she said. â€œHe kissed me and I kissed him back. It was a beautiful and strange time. We were falling in love. For the rest of the press tour it was on, letâ€™s put it that way.â€<9d> Depp invited her to his house in the Bahamas, she said. â€œIt felt like a dream, like absolute magic. â€œI fell head over heels in love with this man,â€<9d> she told the court. â€œWhen I was with him, I felt electricity in my body. I had butterflies. I couldnâ€™t see straight. I felt like this man knew me, saw me, in a way so one else had.â€<9d> But, Heard testified, Depp began to â€œjust disappear, and you couldnâ€™t get hold of him. Heâ€™d disappear and come back. Heâ€™d be different.â€<9d> Heard testified about the first time Depp allegedly hit her, telling the jury: â€œIâ€™ll never forget it. It changed my life.â€<9d> The two were sitting on a couch, drinking, she said. A â€œjar of cocaineâ€<9d> sat nearby, the court heard, and Heard asked Depp about the â€œWino Foreverâ€<9d> tattoo on his arm. â€œYou think itâ€™s funny, bitch?â€<9d> he said after hitting her, she testified. â€œI laughed because I didnâ€™t know what else to do. I thought this must be a joke,â€<9d> she said. â€œI didnâ€™t move, freak out, because I didnâ€™t know what else to do,â€<9d> she told the court. â€œThen he slapped me again one more time. Hard. I lose my balance on edge of couch and I wished so much heâ€™d say he was joking.â€<9d> Heard said Depp slapped her again. Depp then got down on his knees and sobbed, she said. â€œI will never do that again, Iâ€™m so sorry, baby â€¦ I thought I put the monster away,â€<9d> Depp said, she testified. Heard said she knew she had to leave, but didnâ€™t want to. â€œI wish I could say I stood up and walked out of the house but I didnâ€™t,â€<9d> she said. â€œI was heartbroken.â€<9d> Depp, she said, called a few days later to say â€œhe would rather cut [his] hand offâ€<9d> than lay it on her. Depp, Heard said, criticised her choice of clothes â€“ about â€œpouring herself outâ€<9d> in a low-cut dress at a charity event. Then â€œthereâ€™d be a blow-up. Heâ€™d smash things,â€<9d> Heard told the court. â€œHe loves to break furniture,â€<9d> she said, and would often â€œsmash up a placeâ€<9d>. Heard said she noticed a pattern of escalation. Heard testified that Depp was deeply jealous and that his jealousy turned their relationship into â€œa never-ending fightâ€<9d>. â€œIt was a revolving door of accusations,â€<9d> Heard told the jury. â€œI was an acquaintance with someone. And he was accusing me of having an affair with them.â€<9d> At times, Heard said, Depp would disappear to get clean and sober. â€œWhen he was done, heâ€™d go back to being this unbelievable, warm, generous, kind man that I loved.â€<9d> But Deppâ€™s negative behavior returned, she said, and she began to predict his moods and behaviour. â€œWhat kept me in it was waiting for the other shoe to drop, the sobriety shoe,â€<9d> Heard said, adding that she held on to the hope he would eventually be â€œready to get clean and sober againâ€<9d>. â€œJohnny on speed is very different from Johnny on opiates. And Johnny on opiates is very different from Johnny on Adderall, and Cocaine Johnny, which is very different from Quaaludes Johnny,â€<9d> Heard testified. On one occasion, she came down to breakfast to find the kitchen table littered with alcohol and cocaine, and Depp agitated. â€œI realised I wasnâ€™t going to talk our situation down. He was intent on me admitting an affair I wasnâ€™t having,â€<9d> Heard said. Heard said she convinced Depp to leave the house with her to get him to work. On the car-ride, she said, Depp held one of the coupleâ€™s teacup Yorkies out of the car window while howling. Heard said: â€œEveryone in the car just froze. Nobody did anything. Heâ€™s howling and holding this dog out of the window. No one reacted, no one did anything.â€<9d> Heard went on to testify that Depp, who she said was drinking, threatened to kill her while the two were in the Bahamas to sail on his yacht before it was sold to the author JK Rowling. â€œHe slams me up by my neck and holds me there for a second and tells me that he could fucking kill me and that I was an embarrassment,â€<9d> she said. His daughter, Lily-Rose Depp, was upset by her fatherâ€™s behaviour, Heard said, and Depp attacked her because he thought she had told his children about his addictions. Heard then left the island taking Lily-Rose with her. In court, Depp shook his head and said, â€œWow.â€<9d> Heard also testified that her former husband would pass out and lose control of his bodily functions. â€œThis man lost control of his bowels and I cleaned up after him,â€<9d> she said. â€œHe passed out in his own sick â€¦ and then heâ€™d walk around saying he didnâ€™t have a problem,â€<9d> Heard testified. â€œNo one told him. No one was honest with him,â€<9d> she said of the people around Depp. Depp, 58, testified that he never struck Heard, and that, in fact, he was the victim of abuse, and was punched and struck by his wife on many occasions. Depp described Heard to the jury as having a â€œneed for conflictâ€<9d>. In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Womenâ€™s Aid.

The alleged March 2015 incident in Australia has been a focal point of the four-week trial, with details of how Depp came to sever the top of his middle finger sharply disputed by opposing parties. Depp has testified that Heard threw a bottle at him. Heard testified that the injury â€“ which she said she did not witness because she had been given a sedative to sleep â€“ came after Depp sexually assaulted her following a fight in which he accused her of sleeping with co-stars Billy Bob Thornton and Eddie Redmayne â€“ accusations she denies. â€œAt some point heâ€™s on top of me, screaming I fucking hate you, you ruined my fucking life,â€<9d> Heard testified. â€œIâ€™m on the countertop, he had me by the neck and was on top of me. â€œMy back was on the countertop. I thought he was punching me. I felt this pressure on my pubic bone and I could feel his arm moving. It looked like he was punching me. I could just feel this pressure,â€<9d> Heard said. â€œI remember looking around the room, looking at all the broken bottles, broken glass and I remember not wanting to move because I didnâ€™t know if it was broken, I didnâ€™t know if the bottle that he had inside me was broken.â€<9d> Heard also described the aftermath of the night, finding her shredded burgundy nightgown used to wrap strips of raw steak and vulgar messages daubed in blood and paint around the house. Outside the house, she said Depp was still at work, trying to write more disparaging messages by urinating on a wall. â€œHis security looked at me and not laughed, played it off. It was like corralling a wild animal back into the house with his penis out of his pants,â€<9d> Heard said. Heard testified that when Depp returned to Los Angeles he needed to get off cocaine before he could have surgery on his hand. â€œI thought he might die or kill himself. Certainly seemed like the trajectory he was on.â€<9d> Heard later contradicted the testimony of Deppâ€™s security guard Travis McGivern who had said that during a fight in Los Angeles, Heard had thrown a Red Bull can at Depp. Heard says it was Depp who threw a can, and â€œtook a swingâ€<9d> at her sister. After that, she said, she punched Depp. But Heard said that during another fight in December 2015, Depp had headbutted her â€“ an accusation Depp denies. She testified that during that confrontation she felt that this was how she might die. Earlier, Heard told jurors that Depp was surrounded by security guards and assistants who enabled him to avoid the consequences of his drug and alcohol issues. The court was shown photographs of Depp passed out, which Heard said she starting taking in 2013 because he would black out and later deny what had taken place when he was intoxicated. â€œHe wouldnâ€™t remember, or he would deny it. There was no one to back me up â€“ just his employees versus my word,â€<9d> Heard said. Heard later testified about a trip to London in 2013, where she and Depp were filming movies, when Depp disappeared and came home so intoxicated that he was carried into their rented home â€œlike a babyâ€<9d> by a security guard. Heard testified: â€œHis assistants and other security guards were shaking their heads. I remember thinking: surely this is it. He was very sick for at least two days. I felt at that juncture very encouraged that we were on the same page â€¦ that he had hit rock bottom. â€œI understood enough about addiction to know you have to hit rock bottom, have some consequence to get better.â€<9d> Depp, she added, got briefly sober. â€œI thought we were on a good path to sobriety,â€<9d> she said. â€œI felt very encouraged that everybody and I were on the same page, and I felt encouraged that we were in a new chapter,â€<9d> Heard added. But Depp soon relapsed, she said. The court was told that Depp and Heardâ€™s father ran out of drugs at the coupleâ€™s engagement party, and her father left the party with Deppâ€™s security team to pick up more. Heard has previously testified about her fatherâ€™s heroin addiction. Heard testified that she had insisted on a pre-nuptial agreement. â€œI wanted to eliminate any doubt in his mind and in other peopleâ€™s minds. So I brought it up to him and brought it up to my therapist,â€<9d> she said. But Depp, she said, had ruled it out. â€œHe accused me of having one foot out,â€<9d> Heard said, and told her â€œthe only way out of this is deathâ€<9d>. Heard said that Depp would become angry if any of her movies were scripted with sex scenes. She said: â€œEvery time I got a script, it was what kind of, you know, how I was dressing? â€¦ Did I have a sex scene?â€<9d> Heard said she compensated for his jealousy by declining more sexually provocative parts or petitioning wardrobe managers to allow her to dress more conservatively. â€œI had to eggshell or tiptoe around him when I had any kind of scene,â€<9d> Heard said of the conflict. Depp, she said, hated that she worked with James Franco in The Adderall Diaries and had kicked her in the back on a flight from Boston to Los Angeles. â€œHe called me a slutâ€<9d> for the scenes, Heard said, adding how he accused her of liking filming the scenes. â€œHe was being really explicit about my body, about how I liked it. He called me go-getting, a slut. He asked if I was wet, why I wasnâ€™t looking at him â€¦ did James do this and that to me?â€<9d> The jury heard Depp â€œhowling like an animalâ€<9d> in an audio recording recorded by Heard on the flight. Depp, Heard said, had locked himself in the bathroom and passed out. After the Met Gala in New York, Heard testified, Depp had thrown a bottle at her. She told the court: â€œHe shoved me down on the sofa and at some point he just whacked me in the face. I suspected I had a broken nose. I remember it being swollen, discolored and red.â€<9d> Heard testified that a team of detox doctors was brought into help Depp after the LA-Boston flight. The doctors elected to keep Depp on painkillers so he could finish filming, she said. But Depp, Heard said, was taking â€œabout doubleâ€<9d> the number of opiate painkillers he told his doctors he was taking. Depp, Heard said, would â€œnod outâ€<9d> or fall asleep in mid-sentence. â€œHeâ€™d been lying to them so he could get extra-high before he had to detox,â€<9d> Heard testified. â€œI didnâ€™t understand what was going on,â€<9d> Heard said. â€œI hadnâ€™t seen anything like this. I was trying to figure what happened.â€<9d> In 2014, Heard said she started attending daily meetings of Al-Anon, a group for relatives and friends of people with alcohol addiction. Eventually, Heard said, Depp agreed to a detox program under the care of a team at his home in the Bahamas. But the process did not go smoothly, she said. â€œHe slapped me across the face, but he did so while he was crying,â€<9d> Heard said. â€œI shouldnâ€™t have been there. I donâ€™t know how to detox someone. I donâ€™t know why the doctors and nurses wanted me to be there. It was hell.â€<9d> The court is out on Friday and all of next week, leaving jurors 10 days to mull Heardâ€™s testimony before Deppâ€™s counsel can mount a cross-examination. â€¢ This article was amended on 6 May 2022. The group for relatives and friends of people with alcohol addiction is Al-Anon, not Alcoholics Anonymous as an earlier version said due to an editing error. The latter is for alcoholics themselves.

Heardâ€™s attorneys, meanwhile, argued that her allegations are true, she had a right to express her views, â€œand all Mr Depp has wanted to do is humiliate Amber, to haunt her, to wreck her careerâ€<9d>. Opposing profiles of the movie stars â€“ with Heardâ€™s counsel presenting Depp as â€œan obsessed ex-husband hellbent on revengeâ€<9d> and Heard described as a woman who would â€œresort to physical violence, throwing things, to prevent Mr Depp from leavingâ€<9d> â€“ were heard during opening statements. â€œToday, his name is associated with a lie. A statement issued by his former wife,â€<9d> Deppâ€™s attorney Ben Chew said on Tuesday. â€œYou will learn during the trial that Miss Heardâ€™s accusations were prompted by Mr Deppâ€™s request for a divorce.â€<9d> Heardâ€™s attorney later said they would present evidence during the trial to show that Depp had described â€œthe violent side of himself as the monsterâ€<9d> while engaging in â€œcrushing drug and alcohol abuseâ€<9d>. â€œAmber Heard never wanted to unearth for the public who the real Johnny Depp is,â€<9d> her attorney Ben Rottenborn said. â€œBut thatâ€™s going to come out over the course of this trial.â€<9d> The estranged couple arrived at the court in Fairfax, Virginia â€“ Depp in a dark blue suit, black shirt and cream tie; Heard in a grey blazer with her hair in a low bun â€“ amid a throng of fans, whom they have both been instructed to avoid. Deppâ€™s attorneys claimed Heardâ€™s opinion article in the Washington Post, published on the eve of the cinema release of Aquaman, in which she acted, â€œfalsely and unfairly cast Mr Depp as a villainâ€<9d>. The actor, said his attorney Camille Vasquez, will â€œgo to his grave knowing that whatever he does there will always be people who believe he abused a womanâ€<9d>. Vasquez also accused Heard of stagecraft. â€œShe has been living and breathing this lie for years now,â€<9d> she said. â€œShe is preparing to give the performance of a lifetime in this trial.â€<9d> Heardâ€™s attorneyâ€™s countered that Deppâ€™s accusations against his ex-wife were designed to â€œmislead youâ€<9d> and their clientâ€™s case was about her right to free speech under the first amendment. â€œThatâ€™s what youâ€™re being asked to decide,â€<9d> said J Ben Rottenborn, an attorney for Heard. The lawyer also noted that Depp is trying to prove â€œthe words Miss Heard used were about him and were false â€¦ and he canâ€™t do thatâ€<9d>. â€œMr Deppâ€™s team is going to try to turn this case into a soap opera. Why, Iâ€™m not sure, because the evidence isnâ€™t pretty for Mr Depp.â€<9d> The mudslinging, which will probably last seven weeks, is unlikely to do either actorâ€™s career any favors. Both claim their reputations have been significantly damaged by the other, but it is Depp who brought the defamation action on the basis of the 2018 Washington Post article in which Heard wrote about domestic violence towards women â€“ and implied, according to Depp, that he was the perpetrator. Depp, 58, is suing Heard, 35, for $50m over the article; Heard is counter-suing for $100m. For Depp to prevail, jurors must â€œprove by clear and convincing evidenceâ€<9d> that Heard knowingly made false claims â€“ a standard of proof that is typical of civil cases and is somewhat less rigorous that â€œbeyond reasonable doubtâ€<9d>. Trial observers have noted that Depp is not suing the Washington Post itself, which some have said suggests that his action may not be fundamentally about libel, but about the messy end of a turbulent marriage acted out in public. â€œThese fictitious claims were never made at the onset of Amberâ€™s allegations in 2016, and only advantageously surfaced years later once she was sued for defamation after noting in her op-ed that she was a victim of â€˜sexual violenceâ€<9d>, a spokesperson for Depp said later. â€œThis follows a pattern of her elaborate, erroneous claims which have continued to change and evolve over time for the purpose of Hollywood shock value of which Amber has mastered and used to exploit a serious social movement,â€<9d> they added. Some famous faces are expected to testify, including the actor Paul Bettany, who texted with Depp about Heard; the actor James Franco, who allegedly once asked Heard about bruises on her face after a row with Depp; the actor Ellen Barkin; and the Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, who is Heardâ€™s former boyfriend.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

The 58-year-old actor could also be discerned shouting â€œShut up, fat a**â€<9d> after Heard told him to â€œput your cigarettes out on someone else! You f***ing have consequences for your actions!â€<9d> But Deppâ€™s lawyers later played a tape in which Heard said to her husband, â€œI want couch. By the way, you just threw a f**king cigarette on me.â€<9d> Asked what the exchange meant, Depp explained â€œitâ€™s pretty clear sheâ€™s ordering me on the couchâ€<9d>. He acknowledged he may have flicked cigarette ash at her. â€œSheâ€™s not screaming in pain as if I put a cigarette out on herâ€<9d>, adding any suggestion he had was â€œridiculousâ€<9d>. Ben King, a British house manager-butler employed by Disney to manage the coupleâ€™s rented house in Australia, described overhearing an argument in which Heard said, â€œWhyâ€™d you take your hand away from me, Johnny? Donâ€™t you love me anymore?â€<9d> â€œI think he replied, â€˜Of course I do, donâ€™t be silly.â€™â€<9d> King continued, and described Heardâ€™s tone as â€œlike a spoiled teenage childâ€<9d>. After a marital argument escalated, King testified that he found Deppâ€™s severed fingertip â€œdirectly below the barâ€<9d>. But in other exchanges in the Alexandria, Virginia, courtroom on Monday, Depp wrote to his former wifeâ€™s mother describing himself as a â€œpoor old junkieâ€<9d> who depended on his wife and her family. â€œWhat you do need to know [is] that your daughter has risen far above the nightmarish task of taking care of this poor old junkie. Never a second has gone by that she didnâ€™t look out for me, to have her eyes on me to make sure that I was OK,â€<9d> he wrote, the court heard. â€œShe has the strength of a thousand men,â€<9d> Depp added in the note. The exchange came close to the end of Heardâ€™s attorneysâ€™ opportunity, with Depp on the witness stand, to paint the actor as a violent domestic abuser whose behavior was integral to dependencies on drugs and alcohol. The actor has described the accusations of substance abuse as â€œgrossly embellishedâ€<9d> and argued it was Heard who escalated their fights to violence. In one recording, Depp and Heard could be heard negotiating time-outs to their disputes, with Heard saying she could not trust her husband to resume their discussions. â€œHow can I trust you that it will be a few minutes when youâ€™ve done this in the past and disappeared for hours?â€<9d> Heard says. â€œIn arguments you tend to throw punches,â€<9d> Depp says. â€œIâ€™m talking arguments, not the times when itâ€™s physical,â€<9d> Heard responds. â€œYou take off right away. You donâ€™t deal with the issue. You donâ€™t deal with the confrontation. And you split. You do for an indeterminate amount of time. You do it without actually respecting me.â€<9d> Under questioning from his own lawyers, Depp was asked how he felt about the article Heard wrote for the Washington Post describing herself as a â€œpublic figure representing domestic abuseâ€<9d> two years after sheâ€™d been granted a restraining order against him for throwing a cell phone. â€œAt that point it had been a good two solid years since the allegations had been planted firmly on my back,â€<9d> Depp testified. â€œI couldnâ€™t believe it â€¦ it was clear that, the more hit pieces came out on me, it was clear that Ms Heardâ€™s righteous chase against me was continuing.â€<9d> â€œSomething had to be done,â€<9d> he said, referring to bringing the defamation complaint in Virginia. â€œI couldnâ€™t take it anymore.â€<9d> Depp said he felt he had no opportunity to address the allegations against him, and by then Disney had dropped him from the Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise. â€œIt hurt, like somebody hit me in the head with a two-by-four. Even if I tried to do an interview to explain myself, it turned into a hit piece.â€<9d> On Monday, a recording was played of Depp and Heard discussing how to manage domestic violence claims that were already in the press. â€œI donâ€™t know how to get my, um, reputation back,â€<9d> Heard says. Depp suggested they write a joint letter saying they love each other and blaming the media for creating a storm. Earlier, Heardâ€™s attorney, Ben Rottenborn, had shown Depp negative news articles he said would show that the actorâ€™s bad press preceded the 2018 Washington Post article at the center of the case. â€œIâ€™ve been in the racket of Hollywood since 1984 â€¦ of course people write negative stories,â€<9d> Depp countered. Depp also explained that his texts to his actor friend Paul Bettany in which heâ€™d said â€œLetâ€™s drown her before we burn her. I will f*** her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure sheâ€™s deadâ€<9d> were never â€œintended to be realâ€<9d>. The text about burning Heard, he said, was directly from Monty Python and the sketch about burning witches and then drowning the witches. â€œThis is a film weâ€™d all watch when we were 10 â€“ itâ€™s just irreverent and abstract humor.â€<9d> The actor told the jury that when he used the term â€œmonsterâ€<9d> it was his term to describe himself when heâ€™d relapsed out of addiction recovery, or failed to attain sobriety. In his arguments with Heard, he said that when the tenor of the exchanges was reduced to scream obscenities, â€œthe monster was just, for me, was a guy whoâ€™s dumb enough to take part in arguments that would ultimately went nowhere.â€<9d> For both plaintiff and defendant, much of the legal trial has been about establishing probability that their account makes the alleged defamation seem more feasible or unlikely.

The cross-examination by Heardâ€™s attorneys followed two days of unopposed testimony by Depp, in which the actor painted Heard as the aggressor in their three-year marriage. Depp, 58, has accused Heard of defaming him with false accusations that ruined his reputation and career; Heard, 36, is counter-suing for $100m, claiming that she told the truth and that her opinion was protected free speech when she wrote that she was as a â€œpublic figure representing domestic abuseâ€<9d> in a 2018 Washington Post article. Attorneys for Heard sought to undermine Deppâ€™s libel lawsuit against her by forensically examining his use of alcohol and drugs and presenting evidence of erratic or abusive behavior. Throughout the day Depp appeared combative as exhibit after exhibit of alleged psychological or physical hostility toward Heard, coupled with Deppâ€™s often damaging texts, audio or video commentary, were shown to the jury. Amongst them were Deppâ€™s history of damaging hotel rooms, smashing a bathroom sconce during an argument with his former wife, and defacing a mirror with â€œstarring Billy Bob and Easy Amberâ€<9d>; a painting daubed with a penis; and a lampshade â€“ each in his own blood mixed with paint. In that episode, after losing the top of his finger during an argument with Heard in Australia, Heardâ€™s attorney produced texts in which Depp said he had injured it himself. Depp has accused Heard of throwing a bottle of vodka, striking his finger. In another incident during which Depp allegedly head-butted Heard â€“ an accusation he denies â€“ the actor testified that he was â€œtrying to restrain Ms Heardâ€<9d>. â€œIf she was trying to move around and kick at me, any kind of movement, when youâ€™re close itâ€™s not impossible for them to bump, but a head-butt is pretty extreme,â€<9d> Depp said. In a later recording, Depp appeared to admit that he had head-butted Heard â€œbut not to degree that he could have broken her noseâ€<9d>. On the tape, Heard then threatened to tell her side of the story which, she said in a recording, would differ from his. â€œI went too far in our fight and I promise you it will never happen again,â€<9d> Depp later texted Heardâ€™s father. Jurors were shown a video, filmed by Heard, of Depp punching kitchen cabinets and pouring himself a jar of wine. â€œMotherfucker! Motherfucker!â€<9d> Depp could be heard shouting. Heard asks, â€œWhat happened? All I did was say sorry. Did something happen to you? I donâ€™t think so. You drank this whole thing this morning? Youâ€™re smashing shit.â€<9d> Depp responded to video, â€œClearly I was having a bad time. I donâ€™t know what with regard to, but being illegally recorded by your chosen other is quite fitting with the rest of the photographs and tape recordings,â€<9d> he said. â€œShe tried to hide it from me and laughed and smiled at the end. That was the most interesting part.â€<9d> At times, Depp jousted with Heardâ€™s attorneys, while they have allowed him to ramble. The court saw video â€“ shot by Heard â€“ of an intoxicated Depp pouring himself a large glass of wine; heard sound of Depp vomiting, and referring to his wife as a â€œlesbian camp counsellorâ€<9d>. The issue for each party is credibility, as each has attempted to shred the otherâ€™s. At the start of the legal showdown in Fairfax, Virginia, 10 days ago, Heardâ€™s attorneys said Depp physically and sexually assaulted her while abusing drugs and alcohol. On Thursday they followed up, asking Depp about text messages he shared with the actor Paul Bettany, singers Patti Smith and Marilyn Manson (real name Brian Warner), as well as his doctor and chief of security, Stephen Deuters. In several of the messages, Depp used the term â€œmonsterâ€<9d> to describe the person he became under the influence of drugs and alcohol. The court heard damning exchanges from 2013 and 2014 between Depp and Bettany in which he described his desire to harm Heard: â€œLetâ€™s drown her before we burn her!!!â€<9d> he wrote, and said he would defile her corpse â€œafterwards to make sure sheâ€™s deadâ€<9d>. As Depp brought the action, the legal burden is his to show that Heard defamed him when she described herself as a domestic abuse survivor. Heard has admitted to hitting Depp on a recording played in court during which she said she struck Depp but didnâ€™t â€œdeckâ€<9d> him. In another exhibit, jurors were shown a photograph of Depp asleep after a 17-hour work day when he was also taking opioids. Heardâ€™s attorney Ben Rottenborn asked Depp if he was aware of the lengths to which Heard went to help him, and played the court an audio recording in which she expressed concern that her husband might choke on his own vomit if left unattended. â€œShe didnâ€™t like it when it was her perception that I was high on drugs and alcohol,â€<9d> Depp said during Thursdayâ€™s testimony. Heardâ€™s lawyers argue that Depp has no credibility when he denies abusing Heard as he often drank and used drugs to the point of blacking out. To that purpose, Heardâ€™s lawyers introduced text messages from Elton John, who was in 2013 helping Depp get sober during the early stages of his romance with Heard. Depp wrote to the singer describing his ex-wife Vanessa Paradis as a â€œFrench extortionistâ€<9d> who, he said, would seek to brainwash his new girlfriend against him. The court also listened to a recording of Depp moaning during a now infamous flight from Boston to Los Angeles. Depp later texted Bettany to say that he drank â€œall night before I picked Amber up to fly to LA this past Sunday. Ugly, mate. No food for days. Powders. Half a bottle of Whiskey, a thousand Red Bull and vodkas, pills, 2 bottles of Champers on plane.â€<9d> Depp has previously testified that he drank only a glass of champagne as he boarded the plane and, after taking two painkillers, locked himself in the planeâ€™s bathroom and went to sleep to avoid Heardâ€™s badgering. Jurors have also been shown a box in which Depp allegedly kept cocaine and several large bags of marijuana. In his text message to Patti Smith, Depp said he was â€œso disappointed in myselfâ€<9d> after a visit to New York City in 2014 in which he got drunk and fought with Heard before they were married the following year. Heardâ€™s lawyers have sought to show that Deppâ€™s loss of work, including being dropped from Disneyâ€™s Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, came before her 2018 opinion piece. They argue that the damage to Deppâ€™s professional reputation was due to his own behavior. In the US, the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

Dr Laurel Anderson, who was employed by Depp and Heard as a counsellor to discuss their relationship, described â€œmutual abuseâ€<9d> between the two. She said that, on more than one occasion, Heard had initiated incidents to stop Depp leaving, stemming from her fear of abandonment, according to Anderson. She also said she had seen photos of Heard with bruises. â€œIt was a point of pride to Heard, if she felt disrespected, to initiate a fight,â€<9d> Anderson said. â€œIf he was going to leave her to de-escalate a fight, she would strike him to keep him there. She would rather be in a fight to keep him there.â€<9d> Meanwhile, Kate James, Amber Heardâ€™s former personal assistant, testified that Heard â€œfelt she had the right to spit in my faceâ€<9d> when James asked for a salary increase. She claimed Heard was taking prescription stimulant drugs, sometimes appeared intoxicated, and had a â€œkick-the-dog kind of relationshipâ€<9d> with her sister, Whitney Heard. Heard, she said, often exhibited â€œmanic episodes â€¦ similar to if someone was on some kind of amphetamine drug. Moving fast, not making a lot of sense. Hyper-organizing.â€<9d> James said Heard also became â€œbelligerent and abusiveâ€<9d>, would scream at her over the phone, and send abusive text messages at all times of day. â€œAll incoherent. I was just someone to lash out at.â€<9d> James also testified that Heard had discussed with her taking psychedelic mushrooms, ecstasy and cocaine, and sometimes appeared under the influence of illegal drugs. â€œDisorientated, partying with friends, lots of heavy drinking, dancing, laughing, playing â€¦ all the sorts of things that go hand in hand with drugs,â€<9d> James said. After a May 2014 argument, James added, she received an â€œemergency callâ€<9d> to meet her boss at the Chateau Marmont hotel. She found Heard with four girlfriends who, she said, had spent the day drinking by the pool, James testified. â€œIt seemed a little conspiratorial to me, kind of like a strategy meeting. Sheâ€™d made it seem like an emergency but it seemed like a pool party.â€<9d> James, in a video deposition, further added that Heard told her she didnâ€™t enjoy hanging out with her husbandâ€™s friends because they were â€œboring and all old men playing guitars and it wasnâ€™t interesting to herâ€<9d>. James also made no effort to conceal her admiration for Depp, whom she described as â€œpeaceful, calm, shy and almost quiet â€¦ heâ€™s such a gentleman, a total southern gentlemanâ€<9d>. Coming four days into the trial, Jamesâ€™s testimony marks an escalation in Deppâ€™s legal effort, which has so far been to paint Heard as a schemer who concocted accusations of his abuse against her, and then attempted to hitch those to the #MeToo movement in a Washington Post opinion article which forms the basis of the current defamation case. Much of the former assistantâ€™s testimony to the court in Fairfax, Virginia, was previewed at Londonâ€™s Royal Courts of Justice last year when James gave evidence that Heard had appropriated her story of being a â€œsexual violence survivorâ€<9d> during Deppâ€™s unsuccessful libel action against the publisher of the Sun newspaper, after it termed him a â€œwife-beaterâ€<9d>. In that case, James said that Heard had appropriated Jamesâ€™s own experience of being violently raped at machete point in Brazil. â€œShe twisted it into her own story and she used it for her own use,â€<9d> she said. Efforts by Deppâ€™s legal team to disparage Heard and dismantle her credibility have also come at cost for the actor. In text messages shown to the court a day earlier, the actor referred to her as a â€œrotting corpseâ€<9d>. That pattern continued on Thursday, with testimony that seemed to show that Depp at that time blamed his drug dependency on his relationship with his wife. Dr David Kipper, Deppâ€™s addiction specialist, testified that he had planned to detox the actor several years ago from dependencies on alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines and cocaine over two weeks on Deppâ€™s island in the Bahamas. â€œHe was concerned heâ€™d never feel normal without his drugs,â€<9d> Kipper said. In August 2014, Kipper visited Depp on the island to begin the process. The actor reported that he was uncomfortable, and repeatedly tried to fire his doctor and to back out of treatment. â€œHe didnâ€™t want to proceed,â€<9d> Kipper said. â€œHe didnâ€™t think he could do it.â€<9d> Back in Los Angeles, Depp was soon drinking at a bar on Sunset Blvd. Kipperâ€™s nurse once found Depp with bloody knuckles after hitting a wall in frustration or anger. On another occasion he kicked in a trailer door on a movie set. The following year, Kipper flew to Australia to tend to the actor. He received a text from Depp asking him to visit and saying heâ€™d cut the top of his finger off during a fight with his wife. â€œThe house was a mess,â€<9d> Kipper testified. â€œThings on the floor. Things thrown around. Things were just out of order. It looked to me like there was blood in the wall,â€<9d> Kipper said. The doctor said he was concerned that Depp was not following his protocols and threatened to withdraw his care in March 2015. Months later Depp texted Kipper placing blame for his Xanax intake on Heard. â€œZanax takes the edge off,â€<9d> he wrote. â€œI donâ€™t take them all that often, just when my brain is inundated with this badgering and half-truths from my wife.â€<9d> â€¢ This article was amended on 19 April 2022.

Christian Carino, an agent at Creative Artists Agency who had represented Depp and Heard, said that Heard had â€œspent timeâ€<9d> with Musk, the Tesla car and SpaceX aerospace company owner, while she sought to resurrect her relationship with Depp in 2016, the jury heard at Fairfax county court, Virginia, where the trial is taking place. This was two months after she had made allegations of domestic violence against Depp, the Pirates of the Caribbean actor, and the couple had separated, the court heard. â€œYou told me a thousand times you were just filling space,â€<9d> Carino texted Heard about Musk in 2017. â€œYou werenâ€™t in love with him.â€<9d> Seeking Carinoâ€™s advice on Depp, Heard texted: â€œGod, I miss him.â€<9d> In another exchange, Heard texted Carino: â€œI hate it that yet again a man lets me fall on the spikes by myself.â€<9d> Carino responded: â€œIf you donâ€™t like your personal life being in the press, donâ€™t date famous men. You could stop that if you stop dating uber-famous people.â€<9d> The agent also testified that he never saw Depp abuse Heard or saw injuries on Heard, but that her accusations against him had negatively affected his career. â€œPeople do not want to know that someone they look up to is in litigation,â€<9d> Carino said. A year earlier, the agent arranged for Heard to meet with Depp at a friendâ€™s house in San Francisco, despite Heardâ€™s temporary restraining order against Depp still being in force, on condition she would never accuse him of violating the order. The estranged couple, Carino said, spoke for hours â€œinches apartâ€<9d> on the patio before shifting their location to a hotel, where an argument began. The testimony came after three Los Angeles police officers who responded to a 911 call on 21 May 2016 told the court they did not see any evidence of physical harm on Amber Heard who, six days later, sought a restraining order against Depp citing domestic violence against her that night. Officer William Gatlin, one of the dispatched officers to the Eastern Columbia building in downtown Los Angeles, where Depp owned five penthouses, testified that when officers arrived, the female at the residence refused to cooperate and showed no signs of physical injury. â€œBased upon her refusal to give any statement on what had occurred and at the time we did not observe verifiable injuries to her,â€<9d> Gatlin said. Another woman in the apartment, Gatlin said, had told the officers â€œeverything was fineâ€<9d>. Officer Tyler Hadden, one of the officers who responded earlier that evening, acknowledged that Heard had been crying and was red-faced. â€œJust because I see a female with pink cheeks and pink eyes doesnâ€™t mean something happened,â€<9d> Hadden said in a deposition. The officers have testified that Depp was not at the penthouse when they arrived and recorded the incident as â€œverbal argument onlyâ€<9d> in the logs. They testified they were not aware of who Amber Heard was, or that she was married to Depp. Neither Heard nor anyone at the penthouse complex had been willing to tell them who Heardâ€™s husband was. Later that May, Heard filed for divorce and went to a Los Angeles courthouse to seek a temporary restraining order against Depp, showing up with a clear mark on her face which she claimed Depp had inflicted on the night in question. The pictures taken outside the court, together with Heardâ€™s allegations, Depp claims, marked the start of his career and reputation unravelling. The 58-year-old actor says he never hit Heard, her allegations of domestic violence are contrived, and it was she who perpetrated violence during their marriage. Heardâ€™s lawyers have yet to make their case to jurors. Depp claims that he was defamed when Heard wrote an op-ed piece in The Washington Post in 2018 referring to herself as â€œa public figure representing domestic abuseâ€<9d>.

Jurors were told that after Heard made allegations of domestic violence against Depp in 2016, his film work and earnings dropped dramatically. Deppâ€™s agent, Jack Whigham, testified that in 2017 the actor made three studio and two independent films with fees of about $35m, but in 2018 made just two independent films for fees of $4m. Whigham said that for one of those films, Minamata, financing became â€œshakyâ€<9d> and Depp was forced to drop his fee â€œto save the movieâ€<9d>. Disney, which had scheduled Depp for a sixth installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, â€œwere going in a different directionâ€<9d>, Whigham said. Depp, who was due to be paid $23m plus a share of profits, was to be replaced by Margot Robbie. â€œI was not successful in rescuing Pirates for Johnny,â€<9d> Whigham said. â€œAfter the op-ed it was impossible to get him a studio film,â€<9d> Whigham said, referring to the Washington Post article at the center of the defamation action, in which Heard said she was a survivor of domestic and sexual assault. â€œWith respect to Johnny, it was catastrophic,â€<9d> Whigham said. Under cross-examination, Whigham said the article became â€œa death knell, catastrophic thing for Mr Depp in the Hollywood communityâ€<9d>. Depp had not made a movie, he said, since July 2020. Richard Marks, a dealmaker across the movie business whose job, he said, is to help clients to â€œget to yesâ€<9d> and into a successful contract, said that Heardâ€™s allegations against Depp ultimately created a â€œcancel situationâ€<9d> for Depp. Marks said the studios had always put up with idiosyncratic behavior from its stars. â€œJohnny Depp has a reputation for being Johnny Depp. When you hire Johnny Depp you get all of Johnny Depp â€“ and that includes being late.â€<9d> Hollywood, he said, â€œonly puts up with â€˜diva and drugsâ€™ when money is involved, big stars are involved and artistry is involvedâ€<9d>. But the accusations levelled by Heard made him effectively unemployable. â€œIn the past five years, especially with the #MeToo movement you wouldnâ€™t want to hire an actor who had â€˜been cancelledâ€™. Right now the pinnacle of negativity in Hollywood is being accused of domestic or sexual abuse,â€<9d> Marks said. â€œYou wouldnâ€™t want to pay to hire an actor with negativity following them. You wouldnâ€™t want to pay to bring your brand down,â€<9d> he added. Earlier, the court was also presented with testimony from Travis McGivern, a member of Deppâ€™s security team who often worked the night shift. The choreography of disputes at Depp and Heardâ€™s five-penthouse complex in Los Angeles again became the subject of attention, as McGivern testified that he saw Heard punch Depp in the face after he and Deppâ€™s nurse were called at 4am one day in April 2016. McGivern said Heard threw a Red Bull can at Depp from a second level, hitting him on the back. â€œShe threw a bag or purse, she spat at him, a lot of verbal vitriol,â€<9d> McGivern said. â€œTypically, it was Ms Heard directing her feelings at Mr Depp,â€<9d> he added, as the frequency of arguments increased to â€œseveral times a weekâ€<9d>. McGivern said Depp never responded physically. As the verbal insults continued, Depp â€œgave as good as he gotâ€<9d>, he said. The abuse, he said, could include â€œanything and everything â€¦ the F-word is my favorite word but it was being thrown around to the point I was uncomfortable.â€<9d> On the night in question, McGivern said, Heard left and returned with her sister, Whitney, while he was trying to get Depp out. By then, he said, Depp had thrown racks of Heardâ€™s clothes and accessories off a third-floor balcony. McGivern said both Heard and Depp were â€œagitatedâ€<9d>. Typically, he said, Depp would grab framed letters from Hunter S Thompson or Marlon Brando before going back to his house on North Sweetzer, which was once owned by Bela Lugosi. McGivern said he was standing between Depp and Heard when â€œin the corner of my eye, I saw a fist and an arm come across my right shoulder. I heard and saw a closed fist contact Mr Depp on the left side of his face.â€<9d> McGivern testified it was Heard who threw the punch and that Depp had a look of â€œshockâ€<9d> on his face. The actor had a â€œnice little shinerâ€<9d>, he said. Deppâ€™s lawyers will wind up their presentation on Tuesday. On Wednesday, it is believed Heard will take the stand in her defence against Deppâ€™s $50m defamation claim, and counter with a $100m claim of her own, for nuisance. Heard was reported on Sunday to have fired her team at Precision Strategies. She has reportedly hired another firm, Shane Communications.

Is that legit under the way the decision is written?â€<9d> There are also fears contraception could come under fire next. Bidenâ€™s remarks followed the leaked draft of a ruling by Justice Samuel Alito. One of six conservatives on the supreme court, Alito was writing on a Mississippi case which aims to overturn both Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling which guaranteed the right to abortion, and Planned Parenthood v Casey, a 1992 ruling which buttressed it. Hundreds rallied again in Washington, DC, to protest against the draft decision, with polling showing the supreme court is out of step with the majority of Americans. Meanwhile, Biden is facing criticism within his own party for seeming reluctant to contemplate changes needed to enshrine abortion rights in legislation: namely abolishing the Senate filibuster, the rule that requires 60 votes for most bills to pass. When will the Mississippi case conclude? Itâ€™s expected to be resolved in June. The leaked draft is not final. What will be the immediate impact? More than half of US states will outlaw abortion immediately or as soon as practicable. There are 26 states hostile to abortion, with 13 having passed so-called trigger laws, effectively banning abortion as soon as Roe v Wade is overturned. What can you do? Essayist Rebecca Solnit writes how Americans can fight back to protect abortion rights. Fierce fighting under way in Mariupolâ€™s Azovstal plant, says Azov commander Ukrainian forces were fighting â€œdifficult, bloody battlesâ€<9d> against Russian troops for a second day, said Denys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov regiment, as more civilians fled the city of Mariupol on evacuation buses following weeks of brutal bombardment that had reduced much of it to rubble. â€œI am proud of my soldiers who are making superhuman efforts to contain the pressure of the enemy â€¦ The situation is extremely difficult,â€<9d> Prokopenko said. On Wednesday, David Arakhamia, the head of Ukraineâ€™s ruling party in parliament, told RFE/RL that Russian forces had entered the plant, but he said that the countryâ€™s government remained in contact with the Ukrainian troops making a last stand. The Kremlinâ€™s official spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, denied reports that Moscowâ€™s forces were trying to storm the Azovstal plant. Another 344 people had been rescued from besieged Mariupol in a second evacuation operation, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, confirmed in a national address. In other developments, Ukraine claimed on Thursday morning it had regained control over several settlements surrounding Mykolaiv and Kherson in the countryâ€™s south, military officials said. And an investigation by Associated Press found as many as 600 people were killed in the Russian bombing of a theatre in Mariupol in March, twice as many as once suspected. How are civilians being evacuated from the Mariupol steel plant? Russia has said it will implement a daytime ceasefire for three days from Thursday to allow more civilian evacuations from the Azovstal plant. What further evidence of potential war crimes has emerged? The bodies of 20 more civilians were found in the past 24 hours in the Kyiv region, according to Kyivâ€™s regional police chief, Andriy Nebytov. What new measures are western leaders taking? The UK said it was providing $56m in funding to help the most vulnerable in Ukraine and at its borders; Biden said he would speak with other G7 leaders about additional sanctions. The European Union is proposing to ban all Russian oil imports. What are Russia and its allies saying? The Kremlin dismissed speculation that it would declare all-out war in Ukraine in the coming days as â€œnonsenseâ€<9d>. Brazilian presidential frontrunner, Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, said Zelenskiy and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, bore equal responsibility for the war. Donald Trump Jr testifies before the committee on the events of January 6 Donald Trumpâ€™s oldest son has met with the congressional committee investigating the January 6 insurrection, according to two people familiar with the matter. Donald Trump Jr was interviewed on Tuesday as the bipartisan House committee moved closer to the former presidentâ€™s inner circle of family members and political advisers. The younger Trump is of likely interest to the committee because of his proximity to his father on the day of the riot. Donald Trump Jr was seen backstage at the rally on the White House Ellipse that took place shortly before supporters of the then president marched to the Capitol and breached the building. Trump Jr is one of nearly 1,000 witnesses the committee has interviewed as it works to compile a record of the worst attack on the Capitol in more than two centuries. Meanwhile, the justice department has alleged in court papers that a militia group leader tried to ask Trump to authorize them to stop the transfer of power. Stewart Rhodes, the Oath Keepers militia group leader charged with seditious conspiracy over the January 6 attack, asked an intermediary to get Donald Trump to allow his group to forcibly stop the transfer of power.

Thatâ€™s compared with recycling rates of 66% for paper and 50% for aluminum cans.

Deppâ€™s witness, Shannon Curry, said that the diagnosis came from examination of Heardâ€™s previous psychological assessments, coupled with direct examination on two occasions, and participation in a Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) test, a court in Alexandria, Virginia, heard on Tuesday. Curry said that Heard, 36, displayed a â€œreactiveâ€<9d>, â€œoverly dramatic presentationâ€<9d> and used words like â€œmagicalâ€<9d> and â€œwonderfulâ€<9d> to describe events. Heard, she said, flitted between â€œprincess and victimâ€<9d>. As sophisticated, â€œcute and girlishâ€<9d> as such people may present, Curry said, they â€œmay in reality be very destructiveâ€<9d>, â€œdramatic, erratic and unpredictableâ€<9d> and possessed of an â€œunderlying drive to not be abandoned but also to be center of attentionâ€<9d>. Curry said borderline personality disorder represented an unstable personality, alert to rejection, with little access to self-regulation and marked by â€œa lot of anger, cruelty toward people less powerful, concerned with image, attention seeking and prone to externalizing blame, a lot of suppressed anger that may explode outwardsâ€<9d>. Anyone attempting an intimate relationship with such a personality, Curry said, would likely go from â€œidolized to dumpsterâ€<9d>. It was typical of borderline personalities, she added, to be â€œassaultive as partners. Theyâ€™ll make threats using the legal system, threaten to file for a restraining order, claim abuse.â€<9d> The doctor referred to Raquel Pennington, a yoga teacher and friend of Heard. Heard allegedly punched Pennington, who lived rent-free in the Depp-Heard five penthouse complex, on a shopping trip. Curry said that people with borderline personalities can devalue friends quickly. The testimony on the forensic psychological evaluation of Heard â€“ which the defendant would have to have agreed to have aired in court â€“ came during the ninth day of the trial in which Depp is suing his former wife for defamation after she wrote an article describing herself as a survivor of domestic abuse during their marriage. Depp, 58, claims Heard abused him. The court has been presented with witnessesâ€™ recollection of the coupleâ€™s disputes and investigated for their observations of the relationship dynamics that underpinned them, as each side attempts to establish for the jury the probability of their version of events. Earlier on Tuesday, Tara Roberts, the manager of Deppâ€™s residence on an island in the Exuma chain of the Bahamas, testified that she witnessed a dispute between the couple during which â€œAmber was telling him he was a washed-up actor going to die a fat, lonely old manâ€<9d>. Moments later, as Depp attempted to leave, Heard was observed â€œhugging and kissingâ€<9d> the actor as his wife â€œbegged him to returnâ€<9d>. Roberts said Depp â€œstood there with his arms by his side. He didnâ€™t do anythingâ€<9d>. She later noticed that Depp had a â€œmark across the bridge of his noseâ€<9d>, she said. The housekeeper disputed she had ever seen Depp â€œpassed out drunkâ€<9d> but acknowledged he had once fallen out of a hammock and had been found lying beneath it. After that incident, Roberts said, she arranged transportation for Deppâ€™s children from his marriage to Vanessa Paradis, Lily Rose and Jack, to leave the island. However she testified that Jack stayed. Throughout the trial, jurors have heard from a number of medical and mental health professionals. Heard has claimed that she suffers from PTSD as a result of alleged abuse she faced from Depp. But on Tuesday afternoon, Curry claimed that PTSD is one of easiest psychological conditions to fake. Rounding out witnesses on Tuesday was Los Angeles police officer Melissa Saenz, who testified about visiting the Los Angeles penthouse in May 2016, just days before Heard filed for divorce and showed up at a courthouse to seek a restraining order with a large mark on her face that she says came from a fight with Depp that night. Officer Saenz said in a recorded deposition that she could see that Heard had been crying but saw no evidence of an injury. Deppâ€™s lawyers say Saenzâ€™s testimony is evidence that Heard faked her injury to damage Deppâ€™s reputation. The trial continues. â€¢ This article was amended on 27 April 2022. An earlier version incorrectly referred to Raquel Pennington as a mixed martial artist. Heardâ€™s friend Raquel Rose Pennington is a yoga teacher and not the mixed martial artist of the same name. Also a reference to â€œHeard and Deppâ€™s childrenâ€<9d> was corrected to refer to Deppâ€™s children from his marriage to Vanessa Paradis and the reporting of Robertsâ€™ testimony was clarified.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

Youâ€™re done. â€œNo matter the outcome of this trial, the second those accusations were made against me, and they metastasized as fodder for the media, I lost,â€<9d> he said. â€œI lost, and Iâ€™ll carry that for the rest of my life.â€<9d> Deppâ€™s courtroom exploration of his marriage, which will now be turned over to Heardâ€™s lawyers for cross-examination, had earlier reached what in movie terms might be termed a climax as jurors in Fairfax, Virginia, viewed a photograph of the actorâ€™s partially severed finger. Depp testified that Heard had become enraged when he had started drinking in Australia during the filming of one of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise films and had thrown a bottle of vodka at him, severing the top of his finger. â€œBlood was pouring out,â€<9d> he said. â€œI think I went into some sort of â€¦ I donâ€™t know what a nervous breakdown feels like, but thatâ€™s probably the closest that Iâ€™ve ever been. Nothing made sense.â€<9d> Depp said he had hidden in a bathroom, and was later taken to a hospital where he told doctors the digit had been caught in large accordion doors. â€œI lied because ... I didnâ€™t want to disclose that it had been Ms Heard that had thrown a vodka bottle at me and took my finger off,â€<9d> he told the court in his lawsuit against his former wife. â€œI didnâ€™t want to get her in trouble.â€<9d> During Deppâ€™s second day of testimony, jurors also heard of events that marked the the end of their relationship, soon after Deppâ€™s mother died in hospital. â€œI decided to call Amber and tell her that my mom had died that day. I said, â€˜Look, Iâ€™ve made a decision and I think itâ€™s the best thing. Iâ€™m going to file for divorce.â€™â€<9d> He said that he told Heard he would not cite irreconcilable differences or any abuse in the relationship and went to their penthouses to collect some of his things while Heard was at Coachella. But Deppâ€™s security guard told him it wasnâ€™t a good time and showed the actor a photo on his phone of human waste on his side of the bed that was human fecal matter. â€œIt was so outside, it was so bizarre and so grotesque that I could only laugh,â€<9d> Depp said. Asked whether it was possible that it belonged to the coupleâ€™s teacup Yorkies, the actor said no. â€œI lived with those dogs for many years,â€<9d> he said. â€œIt was clear. That did not come from a dog. It just didnâ€™t.â€<9d> Heard later explained that it was the dogsâ€™ â€œfecal deliveryâ€<9d>. Depp said he could not accept that. Later, he said, Heard was on the phone with the artist iO Tillet Wright saying â€œthe wonderful point of just how funny it wasâ€<9d> that Depp thought the delivery was hers. Depp earlier recalled how Heard subjected him to an â€œendless parade of insultsâ€<9d>, how he had â€œwanted to try to make it work, to help her. The Amber Heard I knew was not this opponent. She wasnâ€™t my girl, sheâ€™d become my opponent.â€<9d> Frequently the focus of their conflict, he said, was his drinking. â€œSheâ€™d been pretty brutish about telling me I needed to stop drinking,â€<9d> Depp said, telling the actor he was â€œweak, a complete mess, an alcoholic ruining everythingâ€<9d>. Depp said the exchanges frequently escalated into full-scale arguments. â€œHer need for conflict and violence erupts out of nowhere,â€<9d> he said. â€œI learned to deal with it exactly as I did as a child, which was retreat.â€<9d> The court in Fairfax, Virginia, has yet to hear Heardâ€™s version of events but over a day and a half of Deppâ€™s testimony so far, jurors have been given a tour of an unstable celebrity marriage colored by addiction. Depp is suing Heard for $50m, accusing her of defamation after she alleged violent domestic abuse. At issue throughout much of their marriage, Depp said, was Heardâ€™s anger at his inability to stop using substances. At one point, he convinced Heard to stay at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills hotel while he attempted to come off a brand of potent prescription opioid painkillers, under the care of his doctor. â€œYou wonâ€™t have to sit around â€˜Mr Shakeyâ€™,â€<9d> he told the jury he had said to his wife. He continued in his second day of testimony: â€œShe wasnâ€™t happy with it but she did eventually leave. So for a few days I sat around in a metal chair with one song on a loop so I could focus on the lyrics and the power of the song to help me get through it.â€<9d> On another, after returning from Boston where he had been filming the movie Black Mass in May 2014, Depp said he paid for Heard and her friends to stay at the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles, while he again attempted to kick his habit. He had not been drinking to excess on the plane, where Heard alleges that an assault took place, but had taken two painkillers and locked himself in the bathroom to avoid her badgering, he said. Depp testified that he had suggested Heard also stop drinking and taking drugs, which Depp has itemized as wine, ecstasy, mushrooms, and â€œa high-velocity speedâ€<9d>. Through this extended life story, Depp has weaved in aspects of his history with other women. Heard has said that the first time she was assaulted was when Depp slapped her in 2013 after she mocked a tattoo that had once said â€œWinona Foreverâ€<9d> â€“ a reference to the actor and former girlfriend Winona Ryder â€“ but had since been changed to â€œWino Foreverâ€<9d>. â€œIt didnâ€™t happen,â€<9d> he said of the alleged assault. â€œWhy would I take such great offense to someone making fun of a tattoo on my body? That allegation never made any sense to me.â€<9d> Heard, he suggested was jealous that Depp had not had himself inscribed with her name. Despite the difficulties in their brief marriage, Depp maintains that he never assaulted Heard, the allegation that goes to the heart of the defamation he claims she made in a 2018 Washington Post column. On Wednesday, he repeated that denial saying that his disputes with Heard would never cause him to hit her. â€œViolence isnâ€™t necessary,â€<9d> Depp said. â€œWhy would you hit someone to make them agree with you?â€<9d> The trial continues.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

Deppâ€™s note read: â€œCall Carly Simon. She said it better. Bye.â€<9d> Heard testified she wasnâ€™t familiar with Simon or her work. But Depp, one can reasonably speculate, was referring to Youâ€™re So Vain, Simonâ€™s 1972 hit. His attorneys may take up the issue on cross-examination the week after next. Or the week after that. So it goes with the Depp-Heard defamation case in Fairfax, Virginia. A cautionary tale, certainly, with disturbing allegations of domestic and sexual violence. But also a man-woman fight, part gender-switch Sunset Boulevard, part Mean Girls, with flashbacks and still images taken â€“ appropriately enough given the sinister if not vampiric nature of the relationship â€“ in Bela Lugosiâ€™s old house. Which narrative jurors choose will not be known until after 27 May, when attorneys will deliver closing arguments. For now, with the court out next week â€“ the judge, Penny Azcarate, is at an unrelated judicial conference â€“ jurors are left to mull the last two days of Heardâ€™s take on her turbulent marriage. â€œTwo skilled actors on the stand as witnesses could be equally resonant without regard to exactly where the truth is in their narratives,â€<9d> said Nancianne Aydelotte, a New Jersey lawyer. â€œThis is very challenging for jurors, who might find what the plaintiff said to be compelling and is then equally moved by the defendant.â€<9d> Heardâ€™s testimony, highly charged at times, has been delivered while keeping eye contact with jurors. Depp has kept his head down, occasionally consulting with his lawyers, usually when he seems to find something implausible â€“ for example, that he ingested eight to 10 ecstasy pills in one sitting in Australia, or took quaaludes in Los Angeles. Heardâ€™s overall story is that she was courted and seduced, was bought a colt, and fell madly in love with a movie star â€“ â€œwhen I was around Johnny I felt like the most beautiful person in the worldâ€<9d> â€“ while the world beyond their â€œbubbleâ€<9d> was kept in abeyance. â€œWe werenâ€™t doing normal life stuff,â€<9d> Heard said. â€œWe werenâ€™t stuck in traffic with each other, we werenâ€™t going to the grocery store and doing life. We were hiding in these places around the world.â€<9d> That bubble, she testified, started to deflate when Depp began to disappear and she didnâ€™t know how to find or reach him. Heard argued that Depp became threatened by her career and jealous of her co-stars. She testified that Depp threatened her life shortly after the pair were married, and that just weeks later, in Australia while filming the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean movie, he sexually assaulted her with a bottle of Makerâ€™s Mark. â€œIâ€™ll fucking kill you,â€<9d> Heard alleged that Depp yelled. â€œI was scared,â€<9d> she added. â€œI had just married him.â€<9d> Months later, Heard alleged, Depp broke her nose and ripped out chunks of hair in another violent encounter. Depp has testified that he never hit Heard, and that she was the one who was the abuser, including when she threw a bottle of vodka at him, severing his finger. Heard testified that in her effort to help Depp get sober, she sought help through Al-Anon, and sought to distance herself from the relationship, but was drawn back in whenever Depp achieved brief periods of sobriety and when the â€œmonsterâ€<9d> that the pair called his intoxicated persona was subdued. But at each turn, she said, his efforts were hindered by an entourage â€“ his security team, assistants, hangers-on â€“ who shielded him from the consequences of his drug and alcohol use. In London, she said, his security carried him into their rented home â€œlike a babyâ€<9d>. Some of the most interesting testimony of the past week came from Deppâ€™s accountants. One estimated that Depp had lost $40m in earnings as a result of Heardâ€™s 2018 Washington Post opinion piece, in which she described herself as â€œa public figure representing domestic abuseâ€<9d>. Hollywood dealmaker Richard Marks, a Depp witness, told the court that the film-making community had interpreted Heardâ€™s message loud and clear. â€œThat actor is synonymous with the product,â€<9d> Marks said. â€œWhen hiring that actor or actress, you want a reputation that supports the value that you spent on creating that product. Especially in the last five years, with the #MeToo movement, you wouldnâ€™t want negativity hiring an actor who, quote-unquote, had been canceled.â€<9d> Outside of the proceedings, Heardâ€™s PR team have accused Depp of failing to take responsibility. â€œOne of Ms Heardâ€™s disappointments is Mr Deppâ€™s inability to distinguish fact from fiction â€“ a malady which appears to have spread to his legal team,â€<9d> a spokesperson said in email to reporters on Friday. A Depp flack countered that Heard had delivered â€œthe performance of her lifeâ€<9d> and that his attorneys look forward to cross-examining her. Public relations experts are divided over the consequences of Deppâ€™s $50m defamation claim and Heardâ€™s $100m counter-claim. â€œThis case should serve as a cautionary tale to high-profile people living in the public eye: when you decide to make an abuse allegation, or discuss your personal life in the form of an op-ed, a televised interview, or conversation with a reporter, you run the risk of having to publicly discuss all sorts of ugly private details,â€<9d> says Evan Nierman at Red Banyan. â€œItâ€™s remarkable that Heard chose to author the op-ed that started this entire saga, and that Depp decided to pursue legal action, given that both have more skeletons in their closets than a haunted house.â€<9d> But Juda Engelmayer at Herald PR says that no matter what the verdict in the case, Depp has afforded himself the opportunity to make his case in the court of public opinion. â€œHe got to tell his narrative rather than have it be told by Heard in the Washington Post. He entertained, and ended up getting a lot of people, including female audiences members, on his side. Thatâ€™s how he wins, whatever the verdict, because he wants the world to see that he is still capable of producing fans and producing entertainment.â€<9d> For Heard, the issue may be more complex. â€œShe was considered a hero for putting out her narrative, so now she comes out more of a hero for taking the abuse in her marriage, if believed, and for taking abuse in court last week when he was entertaining, witty, taking it lightly and getting laughs. â€œSheâ€™s coming off looking good also,â€<9d> says Engelmayer. â€œSheâ€™s being strong, bold and unafraid, sitting up there telling her story. Sheâ€™s straightforward, and not backing away from it, and fighting for what she believes is right.â€<9d> Depp, Engelmayer believes, will slowly find his way back into movies, though perhaps not as prominently as before. Heard, he says, also will find her way back. â€œSheâ€™ll get recast in some films to test the waters to see if she has that moxie. She was never as big as Depp, but a lot of studios may think putting her in is a good draw for women, and for progressives who think she was strong and deserves a chance. Sheâ€™ll get the roles, and the box office will tell if she can command them.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Christi Dembrowski, who is also Deppâ€™s personal manager, said she did not share Heardâ€™s concerns â€“ also advanced by a doctor who was treating Deppâ€™s addiction to pain medication â€“ that the actor was dependent on drugs and that he despaired of ever kicking his habit. Earlier, she had testified that her brother had sworn to never perpetrate domestic violence after he was a victim of it himself. But under questioning from Heardâ€™s lawyers on Wednesday, Dembrowski conceded she had been concerned about the pain medication he was taking. Dembrowski also struggled on cross-examination when shown texts she had written to Heard soon after the couple returned from Australia, where, Depp has claimed, Heard severed his finger with a vodka bottle. â€œI love him so much but he needs help,â€<9d> Dembrowski wrote. In a second text, she advised Heard to tell her husband: â€œIâ€™m scared and I canâ€™t deal.â€<9d> Heardâ€™s attorneys claimed that Depp was routinely late for work, including on one occasion being seven hours late on shoot-day on Disneyâ€™s Pirates 5 in Australia. Dembrowski, meanwhile, testified that he was pushed to complete a certain number of movies a year to keep his ex-agentâ€™s income up, hinting that Depp and his ability to earn millions was part of a larger star ecosystem dependent on him. Dembrowski, 61, had earlier testified that Heard had referred to her husband as â€œan old, fat manâ€<9d> and was outraged when he, not her, was offered business with the French luxury house Dior. â€œTheyâ€™re about class and style and you donâ€™t have style,â€<9d> Heard is alleged to have told her husband. The court in Fairfax, Virginia, also heard from Isaac Baruch, the former manager of Deppâ€™s Viper Room club in Los Angeles, whom Depp set up in a penthouse apartment so he could paint. Depp was doing this as a friend, Baruch said, â€œas he has done for many other friendsâ€<9d>. He testified that he had witnessed Depp and Heard argue twice, but never violently. â€œHis family has been completely wrecked by all of this stuff, and itâ€™s not fair,â€<9d> Baruch said. â€œItâ€™s not right, what she did ... Itâ€™s insane.â€<9d> Baruch, a scene-stealer in Hollywood terms with a forthright Brooklynese manner, said Heard was never anything but friendly to him. â€œI fell in love with her, just like Johnny fell in love with her. She was totally gracious, respectful, she had great teeth, and treated me with great respect, and humor â€“ total locker-room, demented humor.â€<9d> Baruchâ€™s testimony was presented to illustrate Deppâ€™s contention that his part in the marriage to Heard was peaceful and that his wife was the abusive party. Baruch testified that Heard had told him that her husband threw a phone at her and hit her inside the coupleâ€™s Los Angeles penthouse. He said he never noticed any evidence of abuse on Heardâ€™s face. â€œIâ€™m looking, and I inspect her face,â€<9d> Baruch said of the alleged May 2016 incident. â€œAnd I donâ€™t see anything ... I donâ€™t see a cut, a bruise, swelling, redness.â€<9d> Two years after they broke up, Heard wrote a 2018 opinion article in the Washington Post that claimed sheâ€™d become â€œa public figure representing domestic abuseâ€<9d> â€“ a libel against him, Depp claims, upon which the lawsuit is based. In a statement on Tuesday, Deppâ€™s spokesperson said Heardâ€™s account of abuse â€œfollows a pattern of her elaborate, erroneous claims which have continued to change and evolve over time for the purpose of Hollywood shock valueâ€<9d>. In 2016, Heard withdrew a petition for a restraining order against Depp and dismissed the domestic violence case against him. â€œOur relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love,â€<9d> they said in a joint statement following their divorce agreement. â€œNeither party has made false accusations for financial gains. There was never an intent of physical or emotional harm. Amber wishes the best for Johnny in the future.â€<9d> Efforts by Dembrowski and Baruch to paint Depp as a mild, if troubled, man, are designed to counter devastating claims issued by Heard lawyers who contend that Deppâ€™s career deteriorated as the result of his drinking and abuse of drugs â€“ and that her Washington Post piece was not what had made him an unreliable commodity to the movie business. The court has been presented with Heardâ€™s claims, part of a $100m counter-suit, that Depp physically and sexually abused his then wife during drug- and alcohol-fueled binges that turned him into a â€œmonsterâ€<9d>. Elaine Charlson Bredehoft, one of Heardâ€™s lawyers, told the jury they would be shown graphic photographs. â€œThey show bruises, they show cut lips, they show hair pulled out,â€<9d> Bredehoft said. â€œThey show two black eyes when he headbutted her.â€<9d> â€œHe has an enormous amount of rage,â€<9d> Bredehoft added. â€œItâ€™s during these rages that Mr Depp engaged in verbal, emotional, physical and sexual abuse of Amber.â€<9d> Heardâ€™s attorneyâ€™s have said the actor and Lâ€™OrÃ©al model would always carry a makeup kit around with her to hide bruises. Under cross-examination on Wednesday, her lawyers made little headway with Baruch on whether he had ever witnessed Heard applying foundation, concealer or any other kind of makeup. Baruch did, however, testify that he had seen the Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, in the coupleâ€™s apartment. Musk is scheduled to be called by Heardâ€™s defence team, who have already told the jury that â€œJohnny Depp is obsessed with Elon Muskâ€<9d>.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

Next week, the 36-year-old actor will get to present her version of events in support of a $100m counter claim for nuisance. Whoever prevails in the end, and perhaps neither, the trial between the pair has been an unedifying spectacle of a horrifying relationship that so far only Depp has had the opportunity to present to the court. The damage to each of them from their marriage, divorce and subsequent highly public and epic legal battles is conspicuous. Heard walked away with a $14m settlement under Californiaâ€™s communal property no-fault divorce laws, using the threat of a restraining order to negotiate for more, but little in the way of a movie career. Depp, too, lost work, having being dropped by Disneyâ€™s Pirates franchise when allegations of domestic abuse against him were made by Heard in 2016. And for both, the long days of recent testimony have taken the sheen off any sense the public may have that either of the actorsâ€™ lives of apparent wealth and glamor were in any way enviable. Instead, it has been a painful story of substance abuse, a deeply dysfunctional marriage and professional woes and plotting. While Depp consoled himself touring with his band, Hollywood Vampires â€“ a group that Christian Carino, the coupleâ€™s former talent agent, testified last week was not a commercial proposition â€“ Heard became an ambassador for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) specializing in gender-based violence. The court was told that the venerable civil rights group had written the draft of the now infamous Washington Post article upon which this legal action is based, and placed it in the outlet to coincide with the release of Heardâ€™s Aquaman superhero movie. Heard, the ACLUâ€™s general counsel testified, had pressed to go further, identifying herself as an abuse survivor, but her lawyers had excised the passages lest it violated her divorce non-disclosure agreement. Deppâ€™s generalized argument â€“ that he was docile as a prescription opioid addict, but wrestled with a â€œmonsterâ€<9d> when drinking â€“ was coupled with observations made on Friday that household alcohol spending dropped from $160,000 a year during their marriage to â€œvirtually nilâ€<9d> today. Some of that spending, Deppâ€™s accountant testified, went toward Heardâ€™s taste for $500-a-bottle Vega Sicilia wine. The grim tableau presented to the court peaked this week with images of Deppâ€™s exploded finger after a fight in a rented house in Australia that was re-decorated with blood and broken glass, causing $50,000 in damages. The unedifying testimony, provided by a succession of aides, agents, concierge doctors, psychoanalysts, housekeepers, doormen and bodyguards, has left the impression of an appalling lifestyle environment that might have been brought to account sooner if there were fewer resources and enablers to support it. â€œI would have required that each of them be in an abstinence-only program with random drug tests that confirm their level of sobriety, and I would have required both to do 12-step work,â€<9d> said New York therapist Dr Darcy Sterling, host of E! Networkâ€™s Famously Single. â€œThe step work is the work that deflates the ego â€“ the arrogance, the propensity to view oneself as a victim with no role in the consequences of their life â€“ so that they could come together without pointing fingers at the other.â€<9d> But the trial has provided insight into how celebrity justice might be warped. Expert witness Dr Shannon Curry refuted an implication that her psychological diagnosis of Heard was tainted by being taken out to dinner by Depp and his attorneys, an inference she rejected. At times what the court has delved into has been bizarre as lawyers sought to prove undue influence. For example, Heard attorney Elaine Bredehoft pressed Curry on exactly who had brought muffins to her practice on the day Heard came for examination. Curry testified that it had been her husband, but that her husband had not known a celebrity client was coming. â€œMay I clarify what occurred so that we can stop talking about the muffins?â€<9d> Curry said on the stand. â€œWhat happened was that I was getting ready that morning, I frequently bring muffins to the office.â€<9d> In the absence of Heardâ€™s testimony, public opinion appears to be so far siding with Depp. According to a Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey, 40% of those polled said Depp is probably telling the truth. Ten per cent think Heard is probably telling the truth. Fifty-one per cent are undecided. Some top celebrities sided with him too. Joe Rogan, host of Spotifyâ€™s controversial The Joe Rogan Experience, said that watching the trial was a â€œcautionary taleâ€<9d> about â€œbelieving in bullshitâ€<9d> and offered that the case was good for Depp, but not for Disney. â€œYou got rid of the best fuckinâ€™ pirate you ever had! For a crazy lady!â€<9d> Others have fretted that the trial, coming soon after the Will Smith-Chris Rock Oscar slap, has bought the entire construct of Hollywood celebrity into disrepute â€“ as a dissertation on fame as a personal curse â€“ reenacted in a suburban courtroom. Derek Long, assistant professor of media and cinema studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said that â€œmovie stardom culturally is less important than it used to be by virtue of the fact the media landscape is fractured and everyone constructs their own personal garden of interestâ€<9d>. Under Hollywoodâ€™s old studio system, somewhat reconstructed in the streaming era of Netflix, stars and their images were closely managed and protected by studio chiefs and publicity departments. There were scandals, from Fatty Arbuckle to Charlie Chaplin, or any number of others detailed in Kenneth Angerâ€™s Hollywood Babylon book, but morality clauses and studio infrastructure had ways of managing it in the first place or at least the narrative of it in the press once it had occurred. â€œIn a pre-#MeToo era there was more of an understanding that terrible things were going to happen and most of their efforts went into damage control, not prevention,â€<9d> said Long. â€œCelebrity bad behavior, or scandal of any stripe, is a lot more in the open now and scandal has become a public part of popular discourse. â€œStardom has always been about been about selling the sense that stars are just like us. Implicit in that commodification was good behavior â€“ that stars are just like you at home, they bake cakes and use this or that brand of household cleaner. When all the bad behavior that goes along with stars being human beings, it disturbs people.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

He keeps cocaine in a jar. He wrote on a wall in blood with a severed finger, and his ex-wife Amber Heard thought itâ€™d be funny if she pooped in their bed and blamed it on the dogs. These are some of the sordid details about Johnny Depp that have been â€œspread on the world like peanut butterâ€<9d> (his words) since the actorâ€™s defamation trial began unfolding on live TV last month. Depp (who claims to be broke) is seeking $50m from Heard, whose 2018 Washington Post op-ed, he alleges, obliquely and intentionally characterizes him as a physically abusive spouse â€“ an explosive charge that he further argues has cost him $40m in lost wages and put him in league with a vast rogueâ€™s gallery of high-profile Hollywood men canceled by the #MeToo movement. But money isnâ€™t the point here. Reputation is. That Depp, a top earning A-lister and famously private before all this, chose to air all of his dirty laundry â€“ the surreptitious recordings, the ribald texts, the prolific substance abuse â€“ simply to remove the stain of #MeToo from his person at the very least shows how deeply committed he is to restoring his good name. No doubt, Depp risks overexposure by untangling his mess of a personal life for wider consumption. So why is he putting himself through such intense scrutiny? Well, for four decades heâ€™s established himself as a fallible star who isnâ€™t easily embarrassed. In court, he doesnâ€™t have to worry about his side of the story being condensed for space, clarity or context. With help from his legal team, Depp can take his time stippling a narrative that rings true to his ear and resonates with skeptics. In these modern times, snarky as it seems, thereâ€™s really no such thing as too much information. Depp might feel he caught a major break when Fairfax county judge Penney Azcarate (Fairfax is where the online edition of the Post, which ran Heardâ€™s op-ed, is published) allowed Court TV to broadcast this tragic affair, effectively setting an actual stage for one of the best actors of his generation to play to the camera and milk his closeups. Perhaps he thinks he can pull off the role of a lifetime. As PR moves go, this isnâ€™t just an extreme gambit for Depp. Itâ€™s the Hollywood equivalent of a nuclear bombing run, with no guarantees that anyone involved will emerge unscathed. Yet here he is smashing the self-destruct button. And, interestingly, heâ€™s not the only one exploiting the nuclear option. While he was battling it out with Heard in Fairfax, former reality TV star Blac Chyna was leveling a $100m defamation lawsuit in Los Angeles against the Kardashian family, alleging that sisters Kim Kardashian, KhloÃ© Kardashian, Kylie Jenner and mother Kris Jenner conspired to break up Chynaâ€™s marriage to Rob Kardashian, which Chyna alleges resulted in the cancelation of their E! network reality show, Rob &amp; Chyna. This Kardashian production was (mercifully) not televised, but both sides seemed reliant on the guarantee of press surrounding the case to redeem or uphold their reputations. That proceeding brought forth tales of Chyna holding a gun to Rob Kardashianâ€™s head, wrapping a phone charging cord around his neck and beating him with a metal rod â€“ all gags, she testified. But the jury wasnâ€™t amused and ruled for the Kardashians, leaving Chynaâ€™s reputation in even smaller tatters. Gone are the days when celebrities washed away their stains in soft-focus network TV interviews. It used to be that when a celebrityâ€™s brand was suffering, they sat down with Barbara Walters, Oprah Winfrey, Katie Couric or Diane Sawyer and over the course of an hour or so on their home turf, calmly answered pre-vetted questions explaining what exactly the world had gotten so wrong about them. But with Walters retired, Sawyer MIA, and Winfrey and Couric not really doing reputation rehab any more, only Gayle King is left as the last sympathetic ear on network TV. And she barely has the airtime or the patience for wayward personalities. The glossy print interview, too, was once a viable outlet for image repair; Depp has been down that well time and again. In 2018 he invited British GQ to his lavish home in the south of France to refute Heardâ€™s domestic violence allegations. But the 8,000-word cover story, which called him an â€œoutlawâ€<9d>, was roundly criticized for glamorizing domestic abuse. When all else fails, social media is another image repair tool. But it hardly has the nuance or the bandwidth to reckon with an affair as complicated as the doomed one between Depp and Heard. At a glance, the court system wouldnâ€™t seem any better equipped to redeem Depp, especially in light of how decisively he lost his 2020 libel lawsuit against the Sun when he sued the British newspaper for calling him a â€œwife beaterâ€<9d>. But where that trial unfolded behind closed doors, this one has played out on Court TV four days a week for the past three weeks (itâ€™s expected to go three more). Depp and his attorneys have been accorded great swathes of daylight hours to cast the one-time sex symbol as a deeply wounded child of abuse whoâ€™d sooner run and hide than strike a woman, and the backdrop and formalities of the courtroom to vouch for his authenticity. Viewers have been introduced to a coterie of business associates who look out for Depp and speak to his fundamental good nature. Theyâ€™ve seen the carnival-like atmosphere at the Fairfax county courthouse â€“ complete with alpacas and Depp fans camping out overnight to secure a spot in the gallery; one day of testimony was nearly interrupted when a galley memberâ€™s phone broke out into the Pirates of the Caribbean-themed ringtone. As these images have beamed across the world, the hashtags #justiceforjohnny and #istandwithjohnny have gotten more traction. Each new wave of support for Depp would seem to give studios cover to hire him again, regardless of the trial outcome. Meanwhile, Heard, who risks losing her role in the Aquaman franchise and future work if indeed sheâ€™s the one found to have been physically abusive, recently sacked her PR team and moved to have Deppâ€™s lawsuit dismissed. Obviously, itâ€™s still early days. Heard has only just taken the stand Wednesday and already accused Depp of grooming her as they filmed The Rum Diaries, and cried through recollections of alleged slaps and kicks and Depp supposedly breaking her nose after the 2014 Met Gala. But for now his nuclear lawsuit appears to be doing the job of restoring his good name in the eyes of his fans and proving that the only way out of crisis is through.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

Laughter from the jury could also be heard throughout the recording, in which Romero, who worked at the Los Angeles apartment building where Depp and Heard had lived together, described the moment he investigated a possible intruder which he believed was just a dog. Romero described searching the property after Heard had reported a scratching on the door that she believed may have been an intruder. â€œThey were talking about someone trying to get into their unit, and in my head I was saying â€˜you really think someone is trying to get into your unit?â€™,â€<9d> Romero said. â€œThereâ€™s scratches four inches above the floor on your door.

At one point he also expressed his frustration with the case, saying that he had been â€œso stressed outâ€<9d> and didnâ€™t â€œwant to deal with this any moreâ€<9d>.

The script is ugly, the walk-on parts unpredictable, and the lighting harsh. Claims and counter-claims of domestic abuse, manipulation, obsession, drug addiction and alcoholism inform the duelling defamation lawsuits being tested in a Fairfax, Virginia, courtroom. Depp and Heard, who were married for just three years, still know how to put on a show even if they are sitting 15ft apart, separated by lawyers and a deep expanse of resentment. Deppâ€™s $50m action against Heard, whom Depp claims libelled him in 2018 by writing an opinion article in the Washington Post that he believes falsely portrayed him as a domestic abuser, has signalled that the actor, effectively blacklisted by Hollywood, believes he has little left to lose. Depp, 58, has accused Heard, 35, of making allegations of domestic abuse against him â€œdesigned to shockâ€<9d> and to â€œmanipulateâ€<9d> the #MeToo movement. Jurors have heard that she initiated the fights. In a $100m countersuit, Heardâ€™s attorneys claim that Depp is an â€œobsessed ex-husband hellbent on revengeâ€<9d>, who punched, kicked and sexually assaulted his wife with a vodka bottle. The Kentucky-born actor lost one defamation trial against the Sun newspaper last year when a British high court judge ruled that it was â€œsubstantially trueâ€<9d> that Depp beat his Texas-born ex-wife. But the US sequel to the London action is perceptibly different in character. Hollywood has come to the Virginia suburbs. Fans, mostly of Depp, are permitted in the courtroom and the proceedings are being livestreamed to millions. In addition to the plaintiff and defendant â€“ Depp and Heard â€“ James Franco, Paul Bettany and Elon Musk are on Judge Penney Azcarateâ€™s list to testify. They will join employees, friends, doctors and psychotherapists who have superimposed a Hollywood make-believe quality on Azcarateâ€™s courtroom. Heard has maintained an air of cool composure against daily assaults on her character and motivations. Depp, too, has presented himself strategically. On the second day of the trial, Kate James, Heardâ€™s assistant from 2012 to 2015, described the actor as â€œa total Southern gentlemanâ€<9d>. One week into what is scheduled to be a seven-week trial, Deppâ€™s presentation of witnesses to support his libel claim is merely setting the stage for his testimony later on. That depends if the actor can plausibly present his former wife as schemer, and not, as she contends, a victim of his abuse. Heardâ€™s alleged libel, his representatives say, â€œfollows a pattern of her elaborate, erroneous claims which have continued to change and evolve over time for the purpose of Hollywood shock value of which Amber has mastered and used to exploit a serious social movementâ€<9d>. Both parties would have had to agree to waive privacy rights for relationship counsellor Dr Laurel Anderson to testify that both Heard and Depp had family histories of domestic violence. Depp had been â€œwell controlledâ€<9d> for decades before meeting Heard, Anderson said. â€œWith Ms Heard, he was triggered. They engaged in what I saw as mutual abuse.â€<9d> On more than one occasion, she said, Heard had initiated incidents to stop Depp leaving, stemming from her fear of abandonment. â€œIt was a point of pride to Heard, if she felt disrespected, to initiate a fight. If he was going to leave her to de-escalate a fight, she would strike him to keep him there. She would rather be in a fight to keep him there.â€<9d> Deppâ€™s legal strategy, say US libel lawyers, has been to show vulnerability. â€œClearly these two individuals brought what sounds like baggage to the marriage. So the strategy is not to gain sympathy but to show the jury what is more likely â€“ that sheâ€™s the abuser or he is,â€<9d> said New York libel lawyer Kimberly Lau. Establishing that Depp was provoked does not in itself provide a defence to abuse. â€œDepp has to combat allegations that he is the abuser in order for the statements to be false,â€<9d> Lau said. â€œEstablishing provocation could help to undermine the credibility of the other party.â€<9d> At some point before Heard has an opportunity to present her side of the story to the jury, Depp will take the stand. â€œAmber Heard is not the star of this drama, though she might like to be,â€<9d> said journalist and Hollywood attorney Allison Hope Weiner. â€œWhen he goes on the stand, itâ€™s him. Itâ€™s going to be a hard act to follow. Heâ€™s going to be very likable. â€œThose movie stars are professionally charming, and even when you steel yourself against liking them, when they want you to like them, you like them.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

The American Civil Liberties Unionâ€™s general counsel, Terence Dougherty, testified that the organization decided to propose Heard as an ambassador for the group after Heard pledged the sizeable donation over 10 years. â€œMs Heard spoke with such clarity and expertise on issues of gender-based violence that [ACLU representatives] decided she would be an appropriate person to ask to become an ACLU ambassador,â€<9d> Dougherty testified. But of the $1.3m slice of the donation that was meant to come from Heard, $100,000 came directly from her ex-husband Depp, and, based on an email from Elon Musk, the court was told, $500,000 came from a donor-advised fund connected to Musk yet registered as a donation from Heard. Just $350,000 was contributed from accounts directly controlled by Heard, the court heard, and another $350,000 came from an anonymous donor, whom the ACLU believed to also be Heard. By 2019, when donations attributed to Heard dried up, the ACLU representative told the court it was the groupâ€™s understanding that â€œshe was having financial difficultiesâ€<9d>. â€œWe didnâ€™t receive any amounts in 2019 and on,â€<9d> Dougherty added. As part of the relationship the ACLU forged with Heard, the group later agreed to draft the 2018 Washington Post article in which Heard said she was â€œa public figure representing domestic abuseâ€<9d> that lies at the center of Deppâ€™s libel claim against his ex-wife. â€œBased on my review of higher drafts of the op-ed, I knew that it was referring to Johnny Depp and her marriage,â€<9d> Dougherty said during the 2021 video deposition shown to the jury. The ACLUâ€™s communications team sought to include Heardâ€™s â€œfire and rageâ€<9d> on the subject, but internal ACLU emails, including drafts and changes to the article, reflect the organizationâ€™s concerns that references to domestic abuse could violate the terms of the non-disclosure agreement in her divorce. Heard, the court was told, had wanted a reference to her temporary restraining order against Depp mentioned in the article, but the reference was removed by her lawyers. â€œI think that Amberâ€™s contributions to the portion of the op-ed that talks about personal experiences is part of what informed the view that this was a strong op-ed, and the importance of womenâ€™s rights issues,â€<9d> Dougherty said. The ACLU and Heard, Dougherty added, were keen to have the article published in the week the film Aquaman was released to capitalize on her role in it. The court was told that the ACLUâ€™s communications department contacted the Washington Post to pitch the article, saying: â€œAs you know, Amber Heard was beaten up by Johnny Depp during their brief marriage.â€<9d> The relationship between the ACLU and Heard, and the groupâ€™s role in drafting the article at the center of the case, comes amid reports that neither Musk nor James Franco will be testifying in the trial. The two celebrities appeared on Heardâ€™s publicly available witness list at the start of the trial, but Muskâ€™s attorney Alex Spiro has said his client will not testify. The Fairfax county court in Virginia was told that Heard had â€œspent timeâ€<9d> with Musk while she sought to resurrect her relationship with Depp in 2016. This was two months after she had made allegations of domestic violence against Depp, the Pirates of the Caribbean actor, and after the couple had separated, the court heard. â€œYou told me a thousand times [that] you were just filling space,â€<9d> Heardâ€™s talent agent Christian Carino texted Heard about Musk in 2017. â€œYou werenâ€™t in love with him.â€<9d> Jurors were also told of Heardâ€™s divorce negotiations with Depp after 15 months of marriage. Heard had initially asked for $4m before escalating her demands, said Deppâ€™s accountant Edward White. â€œIt went to $5m, to $5.5m â€¦ then it went to $7m, and $500,000 to her attorneys,â€<9d> White said, before adding $13.5m for community liabilities under California divorce law. The payments, which Heard requested to come tax free, would have required Depp to make $30m, White said. White was also asked to describe Deppâ€™s alcohol bill, which he said was $160,000 a year during Deppâ€™s marriage and had now â€œdropped to virtually zeroâ€<9d>. Malcolm Connolly, Deppâ€™s longtime security detail and the last witness on Thursday, testified that he saw that â€œAmber wanted to wear the pants in this relationshipâ€<9d>. Connolly testified that â€œshe could get a bit frosty at the drop of a hatâ€<9d>. Over time, Connolly testified over video, he began to notice marks on Depp. â€œIt would be scratches on his neck, maybe a fat lip in the corner. He had bruising on the eye socket. It would get more regular. Not every week, but it definitely happened, yeah.â€<9d> On the coupleâ€™s honeymoon, a train trip from Bangkok to Singapore, Connolly said Depp had marks under his right eye. â€œHeâ€™s walked into a door, or a doorâ€™s walked into him,â€<9d> he said to laughter in the courtroom after jurors were shown a photograph. Depp, he surmised, was not enjoying himself. â€œHe was not happy. Not happy at all,â€<9d> Connolly said. Connolly described removing Depp from the coupleâ€™s rented house in Australia in 2015 after the incident in which Deppâ€™s finger was partially severed, allegedly after Heard threw a bottle of vodka at her husband. â€œIt was like a cartoon exploding cigar,â€<9d> he said. â€œItâ€™s flapping around. I can see bone.â€<9d> Heard, he testified, berated Depp as Connolly led him away from the house to his own apartment where he administered first aid, saying, â€œFuck off! Thatâ€™s what you always do, fuck off with you guys, you big man!â€<9d> the court heard. The security guard said he had seen Depp under the influence of drugs on several occasions. â€œIâ€™ve seen him smoke marijuana,â€<9d> Connolly said. â€œI have my suspicions that when he was off to the bathroom he probably does cocaine. Iâ€™ve never seen him do it.â€<9d> â€œHeâ€™s got a very high tolerance of any substance,â€<9d> he said, adding, â€œI think Jack Sparrow was drunker than Johnny.â€<9d> The trial continues.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

In court in Virginia, Heardâ€™s attorneys then demanded the judge dismiss the action â€“ before following on from Deppâ€™s witnesses with a psychologistâ€™s description of his alleged psychological and violent domestic abuse against her. Without jurors present, lawyer Ben Rottenborn asked the judge, Penney Azcarate, â€œto strike the plaintiffâ€™s evidence and award summary judgment in whole or in part to Ms Heardâ€<9d>. Rottenborn argued that Depp abused Amber in â€œnon-physicalâ€<9d> ways, citing alleged evidence of emotional, mental and psychological abuse presented in recordings and â€œmenacing statementsâ€<9d>, outside disputed incidents of violence. The petition to dismiss was largely procedural. After hearing counter-arguments from Deppâ€™s counsel, Azcarate ruled the trial would proceed. Heardâ€™s first witness, an expert in interpersonal violence, offered a graphic description of Johnny Deppâ€™s alleged violence against his former wife, telling jurors in the dueling defamation case that Heard suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of â€œintimate partner violence by Mr Deppâ€<9d>. Dawn Hughes, Amber Heardâ€™s first witness in her defense of Deppâ€™s libel claim, has told the court in Virginia that she conducted an â€œobjective evaluationâ€<9d> of Heard over 21 hours, and consulted medical records, psychological treatment notes, deposition testimony in the UK libel case and Heardâ€™s mother. Heard demonstrated â€œclear symptomsâ€<9d> consistent with interpersonal violence â€œcharacterized by physical violence, psychological aggression, sexual violence, coercive control and surveillanceâ€<9d>. Deppâ€™s alleged abuse of Heard â€œwas pushing the symptoms, related to the intrusive phenomenon, related to her avoidance, her differences in her moodâ€<9d>, Hughes said. She rejected claims that Heard had probably feigned symptoms of PTSD, as offered by Deppâ€™s witness, Shannon Curry. Hughes testified that Heard was abused by her father and watched her parents struggle with substance abuse. â€œShe learned from an early age how to caretake, how to live in a situation mired in chaos, to take care of a parent who has nodded out from heroin. She learned from a very early age how to figure that out,â€<9d> Hughes said. â€œThat environment taught her that she could love someone who hurts her. She learned how to have this tolerance for cognitive inconsistency, for two what should be diametrically opposed emotions.â€<9d> As she had tried to do with her parents, Heard â€œtruly believed she could fix Mr Depp and rid him of his substance abuse problemsâ€<9d>. Heard bowed her head during parts of Hughesâ€™s testimony. The psychologist, who has testified in the trials of R Kelly and Nxivm cult leader Keith Raniere, earlier testified that writing messages could be considered emotional abuse, probably a reference to messages scrawled on the walls of the house they shared in Australia after Deppâ€™s finger was cut during a March 2015 fight. Hughes testified that Depp was obsessively jealous, interrogating and resorted to obsessive control of Heard. He was â€œobsessed with infidelityâ€<9d> and called leading men or directors she worked with to warn them he â€œhad eyesâ€<9d> on them. Heard adapted to the threat by toning down what she wore to â€œmom jeansâ€<9d> style, the court heard. Depp tried to control what she wore when she was not with him, the jury was told. He would read her scripts to check for love scenes and constantly accused her of infidelity. â€œShe had to try to conceal and maneuver around him to try to have the career she wanted,â€<9d> Hughes said. Hughes said Depp was â€œobsessively jealousâ€<9d> of James Franco, that Heard was sometimes â€œafraid to go homeâ€<9d> when Depp was high on drugs or had been drinking. On a 2015 Boston to Los Angeles flight, Hughes said, Depp â€œstarts talking about James Francoâ€<9d> to Heard, saying: â€˜Hope you had fun with your escapades.â€™ He kicked her on the back and she went forward â€¦â€<9d> The psychologist also said Depp railed about Heard and the actor Billy Bob Thornton. The majority of Deppâ€™s violent and sexually violent episodes were in â€œthese alcohol and drug-fueled ragesâ€<9d>, Hughes testified. Hughes described Depp and Heardâ€™s â€œhighly volatile, highly damagingâ€<9d> relationship. â€œWhen Mr Depp was drunk or high he threw her on a bed, ripped off her nightgown, and tried to have sex with her.â€<9d> There were times when he â€œforced her to give him oral sex when he was angryâ€<9d> or in â€œmoments of dominance of him trying to get control over herâ€<9d>. In one incident, Hughes said, Depp accused Heard of being flirted with by another woman and he performed a forcible cavity search on Heard â€œostensibly looking for drugsâ€<9d>. While the couple was visiting Australia, she said, Heard was subjected to one of the most severe episodes of sexual violence in the course of the coupleâ€™s 15-month marriage. â€œWhen he was beating her and choking her and telling her â€˜Iâ€™m going to fucking kill you, I hate you, I hate you,â€™ he grabbed a bottle off the bar and penetrated her with that bottle. Miss Heard reported to me of disassociating and â€˜going outside of her bodyâ€™. The only thing she was thinking was, â€˜Oh God, I hope itâ€™s not the broken oneâ€™ [bottle],â€<9d> Hughes told the court. At the closing of Deppâ€™s attorneyâ€™s presentation to the court earlier on Tuesday, Erin Falati, Heardâ€™s nurse, appeared via pre-recorded video, telling the court Heard said she had issues with cocaine and alcohol and struggled with jealousy, anxiety and co-dependency in relationships, including that with Depp. â€œI recall a general sense of discord in the relationship â€¦ disagreements, reconciliation and kind of that repeating pattern,â€<9d> Falati said. Heardâ€™s coping skills, the court was told, involved â€œcompulsive anger and yellingâ€<9d>. A note from Falati displayed in court showed an instance when she saw Heard bleeding from her lip, allegedly after an altercation with Depp. Deppâ€™s final witness, the forensic accountant Mike Spindler, estimated that Depp lost $40m in earnings as a result of Heardâ€™s Washington Post article in which she described herself as a survivor of domestic abuse. The trial continues. â€¢ In the US, the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233). In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Womenâ€™s Aid.

That is, until her lawyers played a video of Depp, pouring himself a beaker of wine, raging and shouting â€œMotherfucker!â€<9d> as he smashed up or into the kitchen cabinets. Heardâ€™s neutral disposition collapsed, she dropped her head and appeared close to tears. What the jury makes of that video, filmed by Heard herself in one of the coupleâ€™s marital homes, several court observers hinted on Thursday, could decide the outcome of an action that turns on a 2018 Washington Post opinion article in which Heard wrote she had become â€œa public figure representing domestic abuseâ€<9d>. Last week in the current case, being heard in Fairfax, Virginia, the video of Depp shouting was shown during cross-examination after two days of unchallenged testimony from the Pirates of the Caribbean star. During that earlier evidence he discussed his abusive upbringing, his struggles with drug addiction and alcoholism, he offered musings on brain chemistry, and a self-serving interpretation of the collapse of his career after allegations of domestic abuse surfaced in 2016, the re-educations of #MeToo and other topics. If his defamation case against Heard was purely a legal matter, Deppâ€™s presentation could have been cut short. Instead, it was arguably also an audition, or re-audition, designed to remind the public of his charisma and why he had shot to fame at a young age in quirky, romantic roles like Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and Dead Man. But the Depp of recent years, in his Keith Richards-parodying role in Pirates of the Caribbean, surrounded by acolytes, managers, bodyguards, lesser-stature actors, concierge doctors, psychotherapists, nurses â€“ all of whom have given supportive testimony â€“ is a more challenging proposition. At the culmination of Thursdayâ€™s cross-examination, jurors were shown pictures of bloody daubings that Depp had made with a partially severed finger in Australia; tape recordings of the actor moaning in the bathroom of a private jet, throwing up, and recordings of Heard trying to reason with her inflamed and intoxicated husband. â€œWhat happened? All I did was say sorry,â€<9d> Heard says on the video. â€œDid something happen to you? I donâ€™t think so. You drank this whole thing this morning? Youâ€™re smashing shit.â€<9d> Whatever the outcome of the trial â€“ Heard is counter-suing for $100m â€“ Deppâ€™s testimony, regardless of what the court ultimately makes of it has made for uncomfortable viewing as he has issued repeated apologies to the jury for the trialâ€™s exhibits. â€œIâ€™ll just say that Iâ€™m not proud of any of the language that I used,â€<9d> he offered from the stand last week, and said he often used â€œdark humorâ€<9d> to express himself. â€œFunctionally itâ€™s a libel trial but itâ€™s also the divorce case that never was,â€<9d> says Amber Melville-Brown, head of the US media and reputation team at the law firm Withers. â€œTheses kinds of acrimonious accusations lobbed back and forth are of the kind youâ€™d expect in a nasty divorce.â€<9d> The couple settled out of court in 2017, with Depp paying his wife $7m, Heard keeping their two teacup yorkies, Pistol and Boo, and a horse named Arrow. Depp kept his real estate assets, including properties in Los Angeles, Paris and a private island in the Bahamas and 40 vehicles. At the time, the couple issued a statement: â€œNeither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.â€<9d> To Depp, that agreement came apart with Heardâ€™s Washington Post article. Heardâ€™s lawyers claim she is exempt to libel claims under Virginiaâ€™s current anti-Slapp law that provides legal â€œimmunityâ€<9d> for certain claims based on speech regarding a matter of public concern. Either way, says Melville-Brown, entering into the libel courts, whether in the US or in the UK, where Depp already lost an action against the Sun newspaper in 2020 for calling him a â€œwife-beaterâ€<9d>, is a high-stakes move. Depp has argued that Heard was the one who became violent in the relationship. â€œThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result,â€<9d> Melville-Brown says. â€œHe is expecting a different result. This is a different case under different law with different evidence, different parties, different witnesses, but it all comes down to the same basic allegation.â€<9d> In court last week, much of the testimony focused on dueling portraits of Depp: the â€œsouthern gentlemanâ€<9d> described by a former Heard assistant, or a â€œmonsterâ€<9d> as both Depp and Heard came to describe his personality change under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Near the start of their marriage, in 2015, Depp texted a former security guard. â€œWeâ€™ve been perfect. All I had to do was send the monster away and lock him up, weâ€™ve been happier than ever,â€<9d> he wrote. To one of his doctors, he said: â€œI have locked my monster child away in a cage deep within and it has fucking worked.â€<9d> But the monster, Heardâ€™s attorneys argue, kept reappearing, while Depp has countered that Heard used the word to describe when she thought he was using drugs or alcohol â€“ and that her perception was not always correct. â€œLetâ€™s drown her before we burn her,â€<9d> Depp texted the actor Paul Bettany in 2013. â€œI will fuck her burnt corpse afterward to make sure she is dead.â€<9d> Early in the case, Depp said his public image had gone from â€œCinderella to Quasimodoâ€<9d> overnight when Heard made her abuse allegations in People magazine in 2016. Depp was dropped from the Pirates franchise and has had little movie work since. Deppâ€™s Quasimodo allegory is of course interesting, in part because the hunchback of Victor Hugoâ€™s novel was feared by the townsfolk as a sort of monster, but he finds sanctuary in the unlikely love of Esmeralda that is fulfilled only in death. Many stories are being played in the Virginia courtroom, not least Eugene Oâ€™Neillâ€™s Long Dayâ€™s Journey into Night, but ultimately jurors will need to decide whose credibility stands up to scrutiny. Depp, at times charming and forthright but at others grandiloquent, is close to the end of his testimony. Heard will probably take the stand early next week. She has already proven herself to be an eloquent advocate for herself in depositions to the UK case. The central legal questions of defamation, of reputational fallout from Heardâ€™s alleged libel, have at times seemed spare to the proceedings. â€œEven if the jury agrees he was defamed the jury can still decide she is protected under the Virginia law,â€<9d> says Melville-Brown. â€œI keep waiting for one of them to get up and rush across the courtroom in true movie-style to say, â€˜Sweetie, Iâ€™m so sorry,â€™ shower the other with kisses and say, â€˜Letâ€™s just walk away.â€™ Of course, itâ€™s too late for that now. They are so entrenched in their respective positions in the court and with people around the world, they canâ€™t get out of it now.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

Heard, now 35, described personal experience in arguing for change. â€œLike many women, I had been harassed and sexually assaulted by the time I was of college age. But I kept quiet â€“ I did not expect filing complaints to bring justice. And I didnâ€™t see myself as a victim,â€<9d> Heard wrote. â€œThen two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our cultureâ€™s wrath for women who speak out.â€<9d> â€œFriends and advisers told me I would never again work as an actress â€“ that I would be blacklisted. A movie I was attached to recast my role. I had just shot a two-year campaign as the face of a global fashion brand, and the company dropped me,â€<9d> Heard continued. â€œQuestions arose as to whether I would be able to keep my role of Mera in the movies â€˜Justice Leagueâ€™ and â€˜Aquaman.â€™â€<9d> Heard did not mention her alleged abuser by name, but the timing of this piece indicated that she was talking about her ex-husband, Hollywood star Johnny Depp. Heard had publicly accused Depp of domestic abuse in 2016. Depp filed a $50m defamation lawsuit against Heard in March 2019, arguing: â€œThe op-edâ€™s clear implication that Mr Depp is a domestic abuser is categorically and demonstrably false.â€<9d> Deppâ€™s suit alleged that Heardâ€™s piece left his reputation and career in tatters, so much so that he was dropped from the role of Captain Jack Sparrow in Disneyâ€™s wildly popular Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. Depp not only denied Heardâ€™s allegations, but claimed that she abused him. Heard has since filed counterclaims against Depp, alleging that he defamed her. It has been an immense legal battle between the pair that has generated a slew of headlines and kept both of them in the media spotlight regardless of their work onscreen. But now their made-for-tabloid legal battle will reach a crescendo on 11 April, when the case goes to trial in Fairfax county, Virginia. At issue in the case is far more than two bold-face names: itâ€™s about domestic violence, free speech and victimsâ€™ rights. Thatâ€™s all far from the usual tittle-tattle that happens when celebrities hit the court circuit. Depp and Heard met while filming the 2011 comedy The Rum Diary. They wed in 2015 in Los Angeles, USA Today reported. Heard sought divorce from Depp in 2016. She also obtained a restraining order against him, claiming their divorce was finalized in 2017. Heard won $7m, promising that she would donate this money to the American Civil Liberties Union, according to People and the newspaper. Deppâ€™s rise to immense global fame began in the mid-1980s. His first non-extra movie role was in the 1984 film Nightmare on Elm Street. Deppâ€™s breakthrough came in 1987 when he landed a position on 21 Jump Street. His rise to mainstream stardom was in 1990, when he appeared in John Watersâ€™ Cry-Baby and Tim Burtonâ€™s Edward Scissorhands. Exactly what impact the Virginia proceedings will have on first amendment free speech protections, or victimsâ€™ rights, remains unclear until the trial begins. However, it is all but certain the proceedings will provide as clear an answer as possible about whether Depp abused Heard. â€œThere are a lot of issues that have to be unpacked in any defamation case,â€<9d> said Mariann Wang, who represented former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos in her defamation case against Donald Trump. â€œFundamentally, if the speaker can prove that what she said or wrote was true, that will bar his claim.â€<9d> Roy Gutterman, director of the Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse Universityâ€™s Newhouse School of Public Communications, provided a similar explanation. â€œA plaintiff in a defamation case has to prove that a false statement is published about that person and that it causes harm to their reputation,â€<9d> Gutterman said. â€œLooking at this from the outside, I think the biggest issue is really the truth or falsity of the allegations â€“ whether Johnny Depp committed domestic violence against his wife or then-girlfriend and, on the converse, whether Amber Heard made stuff up about this.â€<9d> Those interviewed by the Guardian had mixed views as to whether lawsuits filed against accusers might deter others from coming forward. â€œYouâ€™d expect the increase in high profile defamation lawsuits against women discussing prior sexual assaults and intimate partner violence to have a silencing effect on victims wanting to talk about their traumas,â€<9d> Carrie Goldberg, owner of victimsâ€™ rights law firm C A Goldberg, PLLC, said in an email. â€œBut instead, weâ€™re seeing that victims with something to say are getting savvier about how to discuss their abuse while protecting themselves from litigation. Weâ€™re getting more cases where survivors of assault and abuse come to us for legal advice before sharing their stories.â€<9d> â€œRarely will a plaintiff-abuser actually be able to disprove an assault or abuse, but abusers sue because they think that will somehow help their public profile â€“ as if by calling their accuser a liar, the public will believe the allegations are untrue,â€<9d> Goldberg also said. â€œMostly, the abuserâ€™s goal is to bring the lawsuit to intimidate the other person into retracting and apologizing. â€œUnfortunately, the abusers who bring defamation cases tend to be wealthy and able to afford legal fees, while the victims are not necessarily of equal financial power. So the victim may be incentivized to retract, rather than spend six figures they donâ€™t have defending a lawsuit.â€<9d> Gutterman said: â€œWhenever we see one of these defamation cases, especially with a verdict against a speaker or a writer, thereâ€™s always a fear of a chilling effect, and the underlying Washington Post column was a serious exploration of an individualâ€™s experience with domestic violence.â€<9d> â€œItâ€™s also important to note that Johnny Depp wasnâ€™t specifically named in that piece, though sheâ€™s always going to be linked to him so it wouldnâ€™t really take much to connect the two,â€<9d> Gutterman pointed out. â€œAs a society, under the first amendment, we want to allow people to express themselves on important issues such as domestic violence and abuse â€“ and I wouldnâ€™t want to see liability attached to [that.]â€<9d> Several of those interviewed noted that defamation cases bring attention to the events behind allegedly damaging statements. High-profile cases will be chronicled by the media. Discourse surrounding alleged wrongdoing will continue â€“ regardless of the outcome â€“ putting to question whether a victorious plaintiff actually wins. The fact that allegations will be litigated in public are â€œoften a reason why many people do not bring defamation claims,â€<9d> Wang said. â€œIt becomes the centerpiece of the trial, so you end up, in fact, prolonging the conversation around the underlying facts,â€<9d> continued Wang, of Cuti Hecker Wang LLP. â€œDefamation actions can be very exhausting and brutal on both sides â€¦ under any circumstance, the underlying accusations are going to be talked about and entertained.â€<9d> â€œThis case is a mess, to tell you the truth,â€<9d> Gutterman said at one point during his interview. â€œAnd in a way, theyâ€™re re-litigating a contentious marriage through civil tort law with these dueling defamation claims.â€<9d> Gutterman pointed to Deppâ€™s unsuccessful defamation case against the British tabloid newspaper the Sun over an April 2018 column that called him a â€œwife beaterâ€<9d>. The judge dismissed Deppâ€™s libel claim, determining that the column was â€œsubstantially trueâ€<9d> â€“ and found that he assaulted Heard on a dozen occasions and made her â€œfear for her lifeâ€<9d> three times. â€œThe court in the Sun case found that there was substantial truth in the allegation even though Amber Heard wasnâ€™t a party to that lawsuit â€“ certain elements of the underlying facts might play out even in the Virginia court,â€<9d> Gutterman also said. â€œItâ€™s already been so messy â€“ and frankly, so disturbing â€“ to see this play out in public, I would imagine the only end game he has is to try to restore his reputation,â€<9d> said Winter Wheeler, a mediator and arbitrator who previously worked as a litigator. â€œIn my opinion, I donâ€™t think that happens from winning this case, if he does, in fact win.â€<9d> â€œI think people have already made a decision about how they feel about him, and I donâ€™t think that thatâ€™s going to change,â€<9d> Wheeler said. â€œDragging your alleged victim back into court doesnâ€™t sit well with your average person.â€<9d> â€œIf I had to mediate this case, I would ask him, â€˜What are you really trying to accomplish here? Because ultimately, youâ€™re not going to walk away with a net positive,â€<9d> Wheeler added. â€œItâ€™s just more people with their eyes on you.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Viewers are abandoning the ceremony in record numbers and, after last yearâ€™s debacle â€“ a bizarre jokeless gushfest held in a train station â€“ itâ€™s hard to see how they will ever return. Fortunately, the Academy braintrust has schemed up two dramatic changes to this yearâ€™s ceremony that should help to bring things back into line. The first is that a bunch of awards wonâ€™t actually be televised live but edited into the broadcast, which will help to make the showâ€™s runtime far less punishing. The second change, though, has already backfired. The biggest complaint about the Oscars has always been that it celebrates a narrow stratum of middlebrow dramas that only exist to win Oscars, while anything too expensive or popular is bizarrely shunned. And so this year the Academy decided to address this by creating a new â€œfan favouriteâ€<9d> category, where real people were asked to vote for the sort of films that real people enjoy. And they did this via a Twitter vote. Youâ€™re already way ahead of me here, arenâ€™t you? Thatâ€™s right. The Oscars chose to popularise their ceremony by handing the reins over to the social media platform that once voted to call a government polar research vessel Boaty McBoatface. As such, at least as things currently stand, the #OscarsFanFavorite hashtag has become a nightmarish mishmash of bad choices, joke entries and protest votes. I say this as an impartial observer, but it has the potential to be absolutely hilarious. In fairness, some of the films you expected to be included in #OscarsFanFavorite are present and correct. Spider-Man: No Way Home, the runaway sensation that single-handedly shocked the post-Covid box office back to life, is among the choices. As is The Suicide Squad, arguably the only other standout superhero movie of the last 12 months. The punctuation nightmare of Lin-Manuel Mirandaâ€™s Tick, Tickâ€¦ Boom! has also made the shortlist, presumably because it makes up roughly a third of all TikTok videos in circulation. Dune is there, too, as well as The Power of The Dog â€“ a sign that the thinnest of slivers exists between popularity and critical acclaim. And then we get into the weirdness. Sing 2 is the only animated film to make the cut â€“ in the year of Encanto and The Mitchells vs the Machines â€“ but that can probably be forgiven due to the fact that Sing 2 is a non-stop start-to-finish blast. There is also Malignant, which is essentially the scientific opposite of Sing 2. Its inclusion here is probably down to the wild plotting decisions that occur in the latter half of the movie â€“ no spoilers here â€“ so perhaps it gained its place as revenge for the lack of awards won by its twisty cousins Fight Club and The Sixth Sense. Then thereâ€™s Army of the Dead. Now, Army of the Dead is not a particularly good film. Itâ€™s slapdash and forgettable, and wouldnâ€™t normally feature on anyoneâ€™s best of list. But you know who directed Army of the Dead? Thatâ€™s right, Zack Snyder. And you know who has an army of angry, revved-up keyboard warriors who still froth with anguish over the end results of Justice League? Thatâ€™s right, Zack Snyder. The inclusion of Army of the Dead is a vote of a support, plain and simple. Zack Snyder could have released a YouTube video of a kitten farting into a jar this year, and it would have still made the shortlist. The same goes for Minamata, a tiny film that has yet to make $2m. Again, Minamata is only on the list because it stars the newly â€œcancelledâ€<9d> actor Johnny Depp, a man who inspires a huge swell of support from a relatively small group of people online. A vanishingly small amount of people have actually seen Minamata, but nevertheless it exists here as a protest vote against cancellation, against Amber Heard, against the Fantastic Beasts franchise, against anyone that turned their back on Depp after a court labelled him a domestic abuser (which is to say everyone except the crew of Minamata and whoever made that perfume ad heâ€™s in). Weirdest of all, though, is Cinderella. Honest to God one of the worst films ever made, you suspect that Cinderella only made the list because it stars Camila Cabello, and lots of people follow Camila Cabello on social media. That can be the only logical explanation. Cinderella cannot win this vote. It must not. For Cinderella to be considered in any way a success would tear a hole in the fabric of reality as we know it. We must stop this with all our power. Cinderella wonâ€™t win #OscarsFanFavorite, though. This is a popularity contest, and No Way Home is convincingly the most popular of the lot. Unless something terrible happens on the night, this is the way that things will go. But I hope the Academy has learned an important lesson here. As bad as your show might be, you must never ever hand the reins to the internet.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

The former home secretary also previously served as secretary of state for energy and climate change from 2015 to 2016 in David Cameronâ€™s government during her decade as a Conservative MP. Her recruitment comes amidan escalating energy crisis, with consumers bracing for household bills to soar in the spring, and as tensions grow between government and suppliers over how to lessen the impact of rising wholesale prices on households. Scott Wheway, Centricaâ€™s chairman, praised Ruddâ€™s â€œwide range of expertiseâ€<9d> and said she would bring a â€œwealth of real-world experience in energyâ€<9d> which would be â€œinvaluableâ€<9d> to the company. She was energy secretary at the time of the Paris climate change agreement made at the Cop21 summit in 2015. Centrica released news of Ruddâ€™s appointment just hours after the companyâ€™s chief executive, Chris Oâ€™Shea, said it was not interested in receiving a government bailout to help it reduce the impact of soaring energy bills on consumers. â€œThere are reports that some energy companies want a Â£20bn handout to keep household bills down,â€<9d> Oâ€™Shea wrote in an opinion piece published in the Sun newspaper. â€œNot British Gas. We havenâ€™t asked for a bailout, we donâ€™t want a bailout, and we oppose any bailouts.â€<9d> Consumers are bracing for a spike in what they pay for household energy in April, when the regulator reviews its energy price cap, a move that many expect will mean average annual bills shoot up by as much as Â£700. This increase would take the annual cost of electricity and gas for households on a supplierâ€™s default tariff to Â£2,000, compared with Â£1,300 at present. After 26 UK energy firms collapsed in 2021, Oâ€™Shea insisted that â€œenergy suppliers have to pass on higher wholesale costs to surviveâ€<9d>. But he suggested the government could help consumers through other means, such as cutting VAT on energy bills, or stripping environmental levies from bills. He calculated that the VAT cut would shave Â£100 off the average annual bill, although such a move has been dismissed by Boris Johnson. Oâ€™Shea also suggested that the government should fund environmental and social levies through general taxation instead of household bills, which he estimated would cut the average annual total by Â£170. Rudd will join Centricaâ€™s board on 10 January, and will also become a member of the companyâ€™s safety, environment and sustainability committee, as well as its remuneration committee. This is not Ruddâ€™s first private sector role. She joined the ranks of former ministers stepping into often lucrative private-sector jobs after government when she was hired as a senior adviser to Cambridge-based cybersecurity firm Darktrace in May 2020, just as it prepared for its stock exchange flotation.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

","https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/20/star-cancelled-film-scandals-armie-hammer-kevin-spacey-johnny-depp-movies","https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/jan/20/star-cancelled-film-scandals-armie-hammer-kevin-spacey-johnny-depp-movies","Does Armie Hammer ever yearn for the time when the worst thing people said was that nobody liked him? â€œTen Long Years of Trying to Make Armie Hammer Happenâ€<9d> was the cruel but incisive headline of a 5,000-word BuzzFeed article from 2017 which concluded that only a wealthy white man could not merely have withstood so much failure but have been rewarded for it. The US actor tweeted about the piece, calling it â€œbitter AFâ€<9d> before making a celebâ€™s exit from the social media platform: he deleted his account then quietly reactivated it. Those must seem now like halcyon days. Hammerâ€™s fall began a year ago when messages surfaced online, purportedly sent from him to various extramarital partners, suggesting an erotic interest in cannibalism. Sexual assault allegations were made by multiple women, while an accusation of rape prompted a Los Angeles police investigation. Hollywood tends to act fast when handling a scandal in the age of social media and #MeToo: Hammer was dropped immediately by his agents, William Morris Endeavor. He exited projects including the Jennifer Lopez romcom Shotgun Wedding, Amma Asanteâ€™s cold war thriller Billion Dollar Spy and The Offer, a 10-part series about the making of The Godfather. His scenes in Taika Waititiâ€™s soccer comedy Next Goal Wins were reshot with Will Arnett taking his place. It was too late, however, for Disney to excise him from its plush new version of the Agatha Christie whodunnit Death on the Nile. Shot before the pandemic, the film has remained moored, if not quite dead in the water. Its prospects were not enhanced by controversy surrounding another cast member, the Black Panther star Letitia Wright, who recently retweeted an anti-vaccine video that was described as â€œhot garbageâ€<9d> by her fellow Marvel Cinematic Universe alumnus Don Cheadle. While Wrightâ€™s behaviour is merely irresponsible, the allegations against Hammer (which he strongly denies) are criminal. As a prominent figure in Death on the Nileâ€™s ensemble cast, it would have been too costly and complicated for Disney to reshoot his scenes using a replacement. That was the last-ditch course of action taken by Sony when the 2017 release of Ridley Scottâ€™s All the Money in the World coincided with abuse allegations against Kevin Spacey. His scenes as the billionaire J Paul Getty were reshot with Christopher Plummer, who later earned an Oscar nomination for the part. Meanwhile, loud sighs of relief must have emanated from everyone associated with the action comedy Baby Driver, which also featured Spacey but pipped the scandal to the post by four months. When reshoots are not an option, the best a studio can hope for is damage limitation, burying any incendiary elements low in the PR mix. Hammer appears briefly in the trailer for Death on the Nile, and is still featured in publicity material; but unlike co-stars such as Kenneth Branagh (who also directed the film), Annette Bening and even Wright, he hasnâ€™t received the compliment of his own individual character poster. Including him in promotional interviews would also be too steep a risk, and hardly necessary when there are plenty of other famous faces in play. Disney had similar problems recently with another release. Like Death on the Nile, Steven Spielbergâ€™s musical West Side Story faced a lengthy delay to its release because of the pandemic; it was also tainted by a sexual assault allegation that arose during that pause against one of its stars, Ansel Elgort, best known as a star of Baby Driver â€“ a movie that is beginning to look jinxed. One irony is that Spielberg and the playwright Tony Kushner gave Elgortâ€™s character some bad-boy credentials that were absent from the original Broadway show and the previous 1961 film. In their version, the romantic lead Tony is an ex-con who spent a year in prison after almost beating a rival gang member to death. The actor, who has a face like a scoop of vanilla ice-cream, is far too pretty and pouty to render that backstory convincing. It would be impossible to say whether the allegation, which Elgort has denied, describing the relationship with his accuser as â€œbrief, legal and entirely consensualâ€<9d>, influenced the movieâ€™s miserable box-office performance, but put it this way: it didnâ€™t help. Even so, Disney hardly placed Elgort under house arrest. He was grouped with co-stars for press interviews, shifting the focus away from him and on to the movie. He also made a string of TV appearances in environments that promised zero chance of any curveball questions. The safest route for studios dealing with scandal-struck stars must be to resort to a media blackout such as the one imposed on Shia LaBeouf around the release of the drama Pieces of a Woman. After the musician and actor FKA twigs issued a lawsuit against him last January alleging emotional, physical and sexual abuse, Netflix removed any mention of LaBeouf from publicity surrounding the movie, including the awards season campaign that brought his co-star, Vanessa Kirby, an Oscar nomination. He issued a partial denial. It can even be necessary to quietly sideline actors involved tangentially in another starâ€™s scandal, at least until the air clears. Some press interviews with Paul Bettany to promote the Amazon Studios drama Uncle Frank in late 2020 were withdrawn at the last moment to avoid questions about the dubious texts between the actor and his friend Johnny Depp, which had been made public during Deppâ€™s unsuccessful attempt to sue the Sun newspaper for calling him a â€œwife beaterâ€<9d>. Depp may have been replaced by Mads Mikkelsen in the third Fantastic Beasts movie and had his recent film Minamata offloaded by MGM on to another distributor, but acclaim for the Marvel series WandaVision seems to have successfully laundered Bettanyâ€™s reputation. He was even doing the publicity rounds again recently, accepting GQâ€™s Boss Leading Man award and complaining to one newspaper that it was â€œan unpleasant feelingâ€<9d> to have his private correspondence read aloud in court. Maybe next time he might not join in with the banter of a chum who is fantasising about killing his ex-wife. Just a thought. The question of how far such controversy reaches is moot: bad publicity of any sort is too great a risk. Even so, there may be good news for Disney from a business perspective with Death on the Nile. The picture was greenlit while Branaghâ€™s Murder on the Orient Express (which featured Depp among its cast) was on its way to a worldwide gross of $352m (Â£258m). As in the case of that 2017 whodunit, it is surely the combination of Branagh, Christie, a starry ensemble and a glossy, old-fashioned style of cinema â€“ rather than any one performer â€“ that will motivate the valuable older demographic to see the movie. One of the benefits of star-studded casts is that there is bound to be something for everyone. Itâ€™s like any half-decent biscuit tin: who cares if one or two are broken? No one would pretend that the allegations against Armie Hammer arenâ€™t serious. But in terms of audience recognition, prestige and prizes, he is no Kevin Spacey. Beyond journalism and social media, it may be the case that older audiences donâ€™t even know who he is, let alone what he is alleged to have done. Of course, wariness about returning to cinemas tends to be higher among that same demographic, which means that the release of Death on the Nile will not be plain sailing. If the movie does run aground, it might be one thing that canâ€™t be blamed solely on this Hammer horror. â€¢ Death on the Nile is released on 11 February.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

In his draft of the majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito argues that abortion is a crime by citing a treatise from 13th century England. The show takes us back a thousand years ago to see the drafting of those original laws. A group of English nobles (Andrew Dismukes, James Austin Johnson and Benedict Cumberbatch) debate among themselves â€“ one of them shoots down making exceptions for rape and incest since â€œthose are the only kinds of sexâ€<9d> â€“ while ignoring the protests of an eavesdropping chambermaid (Cecily Strong). Eventually, theyâ€™re joined by a witch (Kate McKinnon) who can see into the future. She relays her visions of progress and gives a rallying cry to women to fight back. Once again proving how utterly incapable it is of tackling momentous political occasions, Saturday Night Live completely phones it in here. The sketch doesnâ€™t even commit to its lame premise: there are only a handful of comparisons between our society and the Dark Ages before we get in a groan-inducing joke about the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard trial and are subjected to McKinnonâ€™s awful mugging. Her call to action at the end rings especially hollow, but at least she didnâ€™t perform another sad piano ballad. Cumberbatch is the nightâ€™s host. The actor admits to being annoyed that all the sketches pitched to him by Lorne and the writers revolve around Dr Strange, rather than his Oscar-nominated turn in The Power of The Dog. Of that nomination, he says, â€œI didnâ€™t win. I was beat by Will Smith â€“ not physically! Not physically!â€<9d> He then uses the occasion to wish his mom and his wife a happy Motherâ€™s Day and thank them over some soft piano. Thereâ€™s almost nothing here in the way of actual jokes. The holiday theme carries into the first sketch, which sees Aidy Bryant receiving Motherâ€™s Day gifts from her family. Theyâ€™ve all gotten her wooden novelty signs from Home Depot. The sayings on them start out innocuous and treacly â€“ â€œMom spelled upside down is WOW!â€<9d> â€“ before growing increasingly accusatory and personal: â€œDear mom, we sucked your teats dry and now you look weird in a bathing suit,â€<9d> â€œWere your ears ringing? I was in therapy,â€<9d> â€œHaving a mother-in-law is like having crabs.â€<9d> Itâ€™s a near carbon copy of a previous sketch from a couple of seasons ago and a case of diminishing returns. The is true of the pre-filmed sketch that comes a little later, in which a teenage daughter argues with her mother and grandmother about her partying. We cut back and forth between the older womenâ€™s grandstanding and flashbacks to their own wild youths, which see them drinking hard, popping pills, driving drunk, having casual sex and throwing panties at the stage during a David Bowie concert. The show has used this template several times before, but it never quite works because the reckless behavior on display doesnâ€™t get crazy enough. Before that though, we get one the strangest sketches of the season, in which a focus group tests out new ice cream treats. Two of the members (Cumberbatch and Heidi Gardner) are gruff cowpokes, and their feedback takes the form of long, soul-bearing soliloquies filled with longing, nostalgia, regret and plenty of cowboy poetry. This ultimately begets a romance of Bridges of Madison County/Brokeback Mountain proportions. It all goes on a bit too long, but it gets lots of points for originality and Cumberbatchâ€™s performance (he seems to be taking the piss out of vocal Power of the Dog critic Sam Elliot). At a prison work camp, a group of convicts pass the time while breaking rocks by singing a blues ballad. Cumberbatchâ€™s prisoner earns the suspicion of his fellow inmates when he sings about â€œsnitching to the wardenâ€<9d> and â€œsleeping with the wardenâ€™s wifeâ€<9d>. Thereâ€™s no payoff to this setup, but the cast is clearly having fun playing broad, old-timey caricatures and their energy proves infectious. Then on Weekend Update, Michael Che acknowledges how the overturning of Roe v Wade will disproportionately affect poor people: â€œMost Americans donâ€™t have access to the same resources I do. The average person canâ€™t just text Lorne in the middle of the night, â€˜Yo, it happened again.â€™â€<9d> Colin Jost welcomes on supreme court justice Amy Coney Barrett (McKinnon) on to discuss the issue. Barrett says she â€œlistened to the case with an open mind and I asked all my question,â€<9d> and encourages women to just â€œdo your nine and dumpâ€<9d>. Landsdown House is a Downton Abbey-style drama. A family of aristocrats is thrown into turmoil when one of their own announces heâ€™s signed up to fight in the front lines of the first world war. His sisterâ€™s repeated hysterics see her continually miss the fainting couch in favor of trashing the entire estate (the poor family butler takes the brunt of the damage). This feels like a ripoff of a much funnier Mr Show sketch from 24 years ago. A cinematic commercial for a new reclining toilet from Kohler (â€œ#1 in #2 since 1873â€<9d>) sees Cumberbatch play a suave disrupter who interrupts a totalitarian toilet training class by dumping out in grand style (he literally uses pages from the rule book as TP). Itâ€™s a funny enough idea, but itâ€™s over almost as soon as it begins. An animatronic performance at Chuck E Cheeze gets cancelled due to a technical malfunction, so the manager gets Reflection Denied, a British new wave band from the 80â€™s, to fill in. Cumberbatch and Bowen Yang perform a (legitimately catchy) queer-themed, ennui-filled song about pizza, prizes and the salad bar (â€œan untouched place where hope goes to dieâ€<9d>). As with most of the sketches tonight, it doesnâ€™t wrap up so much as fizzle out. The show wraps up with a pre-filmed segment in which Chloe Fineman details her role as the showâ€™s official understudy. The setup is an excuse for her to do impersonations of all her fellow women cast members â€“ save Ego Nwodim (who wisely orders her to â€œPassâ€<9d>) and Punkie Johnson, whoâ€™s her understudy. At one point, she also tries to trick Cumberbatch into helping her land a role in the MCU by pretending to be his Dr. Strange co-star Elizabeth Olsen, only for the real Olsen to show up (Cumberbatchâ€™s dumbfounded proclamation that â€œThe multiverse is realâ€<9d> gets the biggest laugh of the night.) On the whole, this was a middle of the road episode, although it was a notable improvement on last monthâ€™s dire output. Cumberbatch, like so many of the hosts this season, displayed impressive comic chops, but wasnâ€™t given much to work with. Meanwhile, SNL failed to mine any humor from the supreme courtâ€™s monstrous actions but given how the bad the political comedy on the show has been for the last decade-plus, that should come as no surprise.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

In 2009, Matt Latimer, a former speech writer for George W Bush, claimed in his book Speech-less: Tales of a White House Survivor that the Harry Potter creator had been dropped from consideration for the presidential medal of freedom because of suspicions in the administration that her books â€œencouraged witchcraftâ€<9d>. What the Wizarding World wouldnâ€™t give today for a controversy of that stripe: one that doesnâ€™t result in lost revenue, accusations of hate speech, and the previously unimaginable spectacle of Vladimir Putin declaring that he knows how Rowling feels. It is in this volatile climate that Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore, the third in the Harry Potter spin-off series, is being released. The movie begins with the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (played by Mads Mikkelsen) slinking into a tearoom, his nose twitching. â€œCan you smell it?â€<9d> he hisses. â€œThe stench?â€<9d> He is referring to the aroma of the muggles â€“ non-magic folk, that is â€“ seated all around him, but anyone who has been paying attention to the fortunes of the once-invulnerable Wizarding World would be forgiven for reading the line as a commentary on the franchise itself. Rather like the fantastic beasts catalogued by the magizoologist Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), the problems facing the series come in assorted shapes and sizes. One of its stars, Johnny Depp, who played Grindelwald at the end of the first Fantastic Beasts film and throughout the second, was asked to leave by Warner Bros after losing his libel case against the Sun newspaper, which had referred to him as a â€œwife-beaterâ€<9d> following accusations of domestic violence made against him by his ex-wife Amber Heard. Two years ago, another of the filmâ€™s stars, Ezra Miller, was videoed grabbing a woman by the throat in a bar in Reykjavik. Last week, the actor was arrested for disorderly conduct in a Hawaii karaoke bar; reports from the same night allege that Miller burst into a private residence and threatened the couple living there. This all occurred alongside the controversy that has swirled around Rowling over the past few years, ever since a long essay she wrote about her gender-critical feminism put her at the centre of the row about trans rights. The world of Harry Potter and its Fantastic Beasts spin-offs has undoubtedly been marred by this. The question now is whether the damage is irrevocable, and even severe enough to kill off future projects. Anna Smith, a film critic and host of the podcast Girls on Film, concedes that the franchise has taken a few knocks. â€œThe fact that both these things have happened to people involved in Fantastic Beasts has cast a bit of a pall over the series for some audiences,â€<9d> she says. â€œIâ€™m not sure they will prove catastrophic, however. There are probably enough people keen on the series who donâ€™t know, or care, what Film Twitter is saying.â€<9d> The novelist Joanna Nadin, who has written more than 90 books for children and adults including the bestselling Worst Class in the World series, believes the significance of Rowlingâ€™s comments is far more wide-reaching than that. â€œIt isnâ€™t just Film Twitter or even YA Twitter,â€<9d> she says. â€œThese conversations go on among young people whenever the books or films are mentioned. She has tarnished her own brand as far as huge numbers of them are concerned.â€<9d> For evidence, check out the online response to Emma Watsonâ€™s appearance on stage at last monthâ€™s Bafta ceremony, where the actor amplified her previously stated message of support for the trans community by telling an appreciative audience: â€œIâ€™m here for all of the witches.â€<9d> â€œThe reason Emma Watsonâ€™s Bafta comment went viral is because this isnâ€™t a limited issue,â€<9d> says Nadin. â€œThis is something millions of people are invested in. The young people Iâ€™ve worked with in the last five years, many of whom are trans, feel betrayed by someone who was a guiding light to them, who gave them a place to feel safe, where â€˜differenceâ€™ was celebrated. Now we donâ€™t use Rowlingâ€™s name or work in the classroom.â€<9d> Even before its current travails, there was a rinky-dink quality to the Fantastic Beasts franchise. From one angle, the idea of announcing a five-film cycle at the get-go felt like a mark of hubris (if weâ€™re being grand about it) or an act of cynical exploitation (if weâ€™re not). Rowling published the Harry Potter spin-off book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them in 2001 to raise money for Comic Relief. Once the initial film, for which she received her first solo screenwriting credit, reached cinemas, it was not altogether clear that there was enough material for a single movie, let alone the other four that she had promised (or threatened, depending on your point of view). Extrapolating a threadbare story from what was originally a slim encyclopaedia of outlandish creatures had resulted in something very close to a two-hour game of PokÃ©mon Go. Released in 2016, the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them movie contained pluses â€“ including fine, intense work from Samantha Morton as an anti-magic preacher and Miller as her troubled son, Credence â€“ but one distinct minus was Redmayne, whose mannered, ingratiating performance made Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump look like a study in Bressonian realism. Eyes darting diffidently, mouth semi-agape in a love-me pout, he seemed to be channelling Michael Crawford in Some Mothers Do â€™Ave â€™Em. The reviews were generally kind, though, with audiences even kinder: the film grossed $814m worldwide (on a budget of $180m). But by the time the second movie, subtitled The Crimes of Grindelwald, rolled around two years later, the tenor had changed. The trade paper Variety declared that â€œreal magic is in short supplyâ€<9d>; the Telegraph diagnosed â€œone of the gravest cases of prequel-itis since Star Wars: The Phantom Menaceâ€<9d>; and the Financial Times dismissed the picture as â€œa fatigued special effects showâ€<9d>, advising the film-makers to â€œabort any thought of Fantastic Beasts 3â€<9d>. The budget for the second movie had risen to $200m but the international box-office was down to $654m. Not yet calamitous, perhaps, but cause for concern â€“ and a sign that the Harrymoon was over. And the pre-release box office estimates suggest that Dumbledore will take at less than half of Grindelwald. What has changed in the interim? Moviegoers have certainly started to react more strongly to the suspicion that theyâ€™re being sold a pup, as proved by the audience exodus from the Divergent franchise (the third episode, Allegiant, tanked so badly that a proposed fourth was scrapped), as well as the decline in enthusiasm for the rebooted Terminator series, where the subtitle of the final one â€“ Dark Fate â€“ said it all. Could it be that the days of flogging a dead franchise are numbered, now that audiences not only have so many other viewing options, but such an array of platforms on which to make their displeasure felt? Disneyâ€™s approach to Star Wars illustrated that no movie cycle is too big to fail. The studio came a cropper in 2018 with Solo: A Star Wars Story, which became, as Vanity Fair put it at the time, â€œofficially the first Star Wars movie to flopâ€<9d>. Two years later, the Disney CEO, Bob Iger, shouldered responsibility. â€œI think the mistake that I made â€“ I take the blame â€“ was a little too much, too fast,â€<9d> he told the Hollywood Reporter, before confirming that â€œyou can expect some slowdownâ€<9d>. The most deleterious effect on the Wizarding World has been caused not so much by lacklustre product â€“ Fantastic Beasts still has fans in abundance â€“ but by Rowling herself. Warner Bros appeared to acknowledge as much when it issued a Secrets of Dumbledore trailer last year in which her name was invisible to the naked eye. Previous trailers had put the novelist front and centre; the first Fantastic Beasts trailer included a title card dominated by her name (â€œJK Rowling invites youâ€<9d>) while The Crimes of Grindelwald featured one announcing the new film â€œfrom writer JK Rowlingâ€<9d>. When it came time to whet appetites for the third episode, she had become the dirty secret in The Secrets of Dumbledore, relegated to the small print at the bottom of the screen. That move seemed consistent with last yearâ€™s reunion special, Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts, which included no new interview footage from Rowling. Screen time went instead to the stars of the original franchise: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, all of whom had already distanced themselves publicly from Rowling, and declared their solidarity with the trans community. Redmayne, too, was vocal in his opposition to her views. â€œI disagree with Joâ€™s comments,â€<9d> he said in 2020. â€œTrans women are women, trans men are men, and non-binary identities are valid.â€<9d> When youâ€™ve got the stars of your own franchise lining up to contradict you, and Putin trying to align himself with your travails at the height of his hostilities against Ukraine (he compared the westâ€™s attempts to â€œcancelâ€<9d> Russia, as he put it, with the treatment of Rowling by â€œfans of so-called gender freedomsâ€<9d>) then some kind of cosmic recalibration must surely be in order. Even those who remain entirely sympathetic to Rowling canâ€™t fail to acknowledge that it is she who is preventing the smooth continuation of the Wizarding World. To use horror movie parlance, the call is coming from inside the house. Regardless of the Rowling controversy, The Secrets of Dumbledore looks unlikely to bring about any miraculous upswing in the franchiseâ€™s standing. Common criticisms that the second movie was all world-building and no characterisation, or that Rowling had cluttered up the first two films with obfuscatory detail, seemed to hit home: for this third one, Steve Kloves, who scripted the entire Harry Potter series, is credited as co-writer. A steadier hand on the tiller would be hard to find, though it hasnâ€™t resulted in an improved viewing experience. The new film feels simultaneously leaden and inconsequential, lacking the depth, clarity or calibre of ideas to justify a two-and-a-half-hour screen time. The good news for Warner Bros is that the Harry Potter brand, distinct from Fantastic Beasts, appears insulated from retroactive harm. Interest in the original property shows no sign of waning, even among those fans who have abandoned their allegiance to Rowling. The stage hit Harry Potter and the Cursed Child continues to dominate Broadway and the West End, while last summerâ€™s reunion documentary went down a storm on HBO Max, where a live-action Harry Potter spin-off series is in the early planning stages. â€œItâ€™s interesting to see the generation who grew up with the books and films â€˜owningâ€™ them now,â€<9d> says Nadin. â€œTheyâ€™re able to say: â€˜These belong to us, not herâ€™ and remove her from the picture, which is, I think, a healthy attitude.â€<9d> But while Harry Potter seems ringfenced by the goodwill of loyal fans, the future of Fantastic Beasts is less certain. David Yates, who has directed every Wizarding World movie since Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix in 2007, confirmed recently that Rowling hasnâ€™t yet started work on the fourth script in the series. Holding fire on that first draft until the takings are in for The Secrets of Dumbledore seems prudent. Unless any graduates of Hogwarts know of a spell suitable for laundering a sullied film franchise, this is a beast that may yet be put out of its misery. â€¢ This article was amended on 8 April 2022 to rephrase a sentence that inadvertently appeared to downplay the actions of Depp and Miller, and to remove a description of a person that was not relevant to the story. â€¢ Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore is released on 7 April in Australia, 8 April in the UK, and 15 April in the US.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

The Netflix hit, which was little-loved by critics, beat the likes of Dune, The Power of the Dog and Spider-Man: Far From Home to take the prize, which is the first in the Academyâ€™s 94-year history to be decided by the public. Earlier in the evening, a sequence from another Snyder film â€“ â€œThe Flash enters the speed force from Zack Snyderâ€™s Justice Leagueâ€<9d> â€“ was crowned â€œMost cheer-worthy momentâ€<9d> in a movie. That honour does not come with an official prize and was met with silence in the auditorium. The new #FanFavourite award was first announced by the Academy in February, in an attempt to insulate themselves from accusations of insularity. Voters could offer their opinions by Twitter or the Academyâ€™s website. In 2018, the Oscars announced the creation of a new category for â€œbest popular filmâ€<9d>, only to scrap the plan a month later, following considerable backlash. Yet the potential for sabotage by handing the public the reins for #FanFavourite was hammered home once votes began flooding in for titles such as the little-seen Johnny Depp drama Minamata. The surge for this drama was thanks to a concerted effort by Depp fans upset by the starâ€™s ostracisation following the collapse of his libel trial. The populist innovation attracted further criticism from members of the Academy after it was announced that eight craft prizes would be announced at a pre-ceremony show and edited highlights worked into the telecast. The lionâ€™s share of these went to Dune, a sci-fi blockbuster and the only real box office hit among the best picture nominees.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

But the annual Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) â€“ the UNâ€™s biggest global gathering to discuss these issues â€“ is an event African women and girls struggle to attend and participate in. If it is not visa denials (this year saw little or no attempt from embassies to help facilitate visas to the US), itâ€™s the lack of adequate resources to fly to New York and stay for the meetings; if itâ€™s not language problems, then it is the minimal time and space granted to deliberate our unique issues. This yearâ€™s priority theme at CSW is for the first time the climate crisis, but the technical language and framing makes it difficult for many African women to contribute meaningfully, despite their vast local knowledge. When you stand on an international podium and you are not speaking the â€œclimate languageâ€<9d> of sustainable development and climate action, you are simply left out. How do I speak good English if I am having trouble interpreting critical information from my own language to the one that is globally acceptable? Even during the Covid-19 pandemic, when the event was held virtually, African women were excluded because not all women can be in the digital space. In most African countries, the internet is so expensive. Between a choice of buying bread for their children or logging on to a one-hour meeting, what will women choose? This is why this year we sought an alternative: African women have launched the first â€œAfrica CSWâ€<9d>. Last week, we convened 60 representatives from 18 African countries in Nairobi to hold concurrent meetings during the opening sessions of CSW66 in New York. We posted our discussions using #AfricaDisruptCSW66, which were then fed to our team, who are closely following the negotiations of an agreed set of conclusions expected to be signed on Friday. My organisation, Femnet (the African Womenâ€™s Development and Communications Network), was created in response to the exclusion of women and girls from conferences affecting their lives. African women and girls need to be at the forefront of their own issues and we must claim and secure these spaces. We are calling for the meaningful inclusion and participation of African women and girls, in all their diversity, in decision-making forums such as CSW and the UN climate change conference (Cop27) to be held in Egypt in November. Weâ€™re also calling for the CSW venue to be rotated from New York to different regions of the world in the same way as Cop. This will open the CSW space and allow for more participation from indigenous communities, young people, women with disabilities, gender-nonconforming people, and women living in informal and rural areas. Not only do African women need to be in these spaces, but we also need to hold our country representatives accountable for what they say and agree to at these conferences. What they say at conferences must represent our reality. If itâ€™s not, we ought to challenge them. We must never forget that we are fighting historical injustices. We are fighting for life; we are fighting to survive. We need to make sure no one can shut us down. Womenâ€™s and girlsâ€™ voices and lived experiences must be heard and prioritised. â€¢ Memory Kachambwa is executive director of Femnet",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

The last Ukrainian soldiers defending Mariupol said they were â€œrunning out of ammunitionâ€<9d> on Monday and expected to be killed or taken prisoner very soon by Russian forces surrounding the city. Writing on Facebook, the 36th brigade said its 47-day defence of Mariupol was coming to a tragic conclusion. â€œWe were bombed from airplanes and shot at by artillery and tanks. We have been doing everything possible and impossible,â€<9d> it said. Meanwhile, Austriaâ€™s chancellor, Karl Nehammer, said he told Vladimir Putin that â€œall those responsibleâ€<9d> for war crimes must be brought to justice and warned that western sanctions would intensify as long as people kept dying in Ukraine. After becoming the first western leader to hold face-to-face talks with the Russian president since the invasion, Nehammer said his trip to Moscow was not â€œa visit of friendshipâ€<9d> and that the two had had a â€œdirect, open and hardâ€<9d> conversation. Scammers have allegedly fleeced at least $50,000 through cons related to devastating flooding across Australiaâ€™s east coast, with criminals impersonating charities, emergency services and government departments in dozens of frauds. New South Wales police have received multiple reports about scams they said were â€œunthinkableâ€<9d>, but no arrests have yet been made. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said at least 45 scam reports related to flooding had been lodged with its Scamwatch project in NSW and Queensland since 1 February. On the first official day of the 2022 election campaign, Labor leader Anthony Albanese stumbled over Australiaâ€™s jobless rate and the cash rate. There are other numbers politicians â€“ and voters â€“ should know and care about besides the price of a litre of milk or petrol, or a loaf of bread. Meanwhile, Liberal moderates have expressed concern that Scott Morrison has flagged committing during the election campaign to a ban on transgender women playing womenâ€™s sport. Australia Peak legal organisations and trade unions have joined calls to reform aspects of Queenslandâ€™s anti-discrimination laws, including scrapping a clause used by some religious groups to justify contracts that suggest they could sack LGBTQ+ staff. Compared with most other countries, Australia was relatively unscathed by the pandemic, although its health results were achieved by severe measures. Scott Morrison said 40,000 lives had been saved. But how is this figure calculated, is it the whole story and who gets the credit for this boast? Councils across Sydneyâ€™s west say some parents are forced to send their children to private schools due to the New South Wales governmentâ€™s failure to plan for population growth, warning that it is exacerbating educational disadvantage.

Whatâ€™s clear, however, is that Marr has shifted slightly from the post-punk stylings that characterised 2018â€™s excellent Call the Comet.

The Fast Recovery Act, or AB 257, would create a statewide fast food sector council that would include workers, state regulators, franchises and their parent companies and set wage and other standards for the industry. The act would also hold franchises and their parent corporations more accountable to labor laws. Workers say the legislation is a means to fight low pay, poor working conditions, and a lack of safety protections â€“ problems that have long plagued the industry but that workers say have worsened during the pandemic. â€œThere are a lot of laws protecting workers but nobody is implementing or doing anything about it. We are essential workers but not treated like that. With the Fast Recovery Act, weâ€™ll be heard. Weâ€™ll sit down at the same table with all the franchises and say if there is a law protecting workers, it has to be followed and applied,â€<9d> said Maria Yolanda Torres, who has worked at a Subway store in San Jose, California, since May 2018. Throughout the pandemic, Yolanda Torres alleges, she and her colleagues have been forced to skip breaks and work off the clock, had tips stolen, had sick pay taken away, and faced safety problems, including abusive customers, that were ignored by the storeâ€™s owners. The owners did not enforce Covid-19 regulations or protect workers when customers refused to abide by them, Yolanda Torres alleged. She was asked to climb into the store dumpster to stomp the garbage bags down so they all fit into one overflowing dumpster, she said. â€œItâ€™s a lot of garbage. Itâ€™s disgusting and itâ€™s not safe. If we fall down, the owner wouldnâ€™t pay me if I got hurt. The owner only wants to pay for the one dumpster when we need two,â€<9d> she said. When sick pay didnâ€™t show up on her paycheck, the owner and managers refused to resolve the issue, she said. Yolanda and three of her co-workers at Subway in February filed a wage theft complaint with the California department of labor. They also filed health complaints with CalOSHA, the stateâ€™s division of occupational safety and health, alleging various forms of wage theft incurred by the four workers for a total of more than $41,000. The Subway franchise owner received PPP loans and Covid-19 grants totaling more than $285,000, according to a copy of the complaints provided to the Guardian. Subway and the franchise owner, Rajiv Kohli, did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the complaints. Yolanda Torres said working conditions like the ones she experienced are common in the industry. â€œWorkers are facing similar issues across fast food franchises in the state, but the owners donâ€™t care about the consequences,â€<9d> she said. â€œWhen owners realize we know our rights and that somebody is listening, the problems are going to be resolved.â€<9d> A recent survey of fast food workers in Los Angeles, conducted by the UCLA Labor Center, found workers reported lack of paid sick leave, widespread lack of enforcement of Covid-19 safety protocols and economic insecurity; 44% of workers surveyed reported not having enough money to afford groceries during the pandemic; 43% reported missing rent or a mortgage payment; 47% of workers reported working more than one job to try to make ends meet. Among workers who said they had expressed workplace concerns to their managers, 25% said they had experienced retaliation for doing so. Jose Ramirez, a worker at McDonaldâ€™s in San Francisco for three years, was terminated on 8 February due to what he alleges was retaliation for advocating for Covid-19 sick pay for himself and co-workers who were not receiving it. He filed a complaint with the California department of labor standards enforcement alleging the firing was retaliation and provided a copy of the complaint. In February 2021, a McDonaldâ€™s franchisee in Los Angeles, California, was fined $125,000 by the state for illegally firing four workers for reporting Covid-19 safety issues. â€œWe need to keep pushing to make AB 257 law and that law will protect all the workers in fast food. I believe if AB 257 was law already, my employer wouldnâ€™t carry out firing me just because I spoke out and demanded my rights as a worker,â€<9d> said Ramirez. â€œOnly united as workers will we be strong enough to fight against all the bad practices in the fast food industry.â€<9d> The McDonaldâ€™s franchise owner and operator Scott Rodrick declined to comment on Ramirezâ€™s case. â€œMy organization does not tolerate retaliation of any kind against our employees. We have not received an inquiry from the California department of labor regarding this allegation. Thus, we cannot comment on this particular employment matter,â€<9d> said Rodrick in an email. â€œWe do, however, firmly believe in creating a safe working environment for all of our employees, including adhering to our high standards for Covid safety as we all work together to help contain the pandemic. Everyone working within my organization has the obligation to uphold those safety standards.â€<9d> California has more than 550,000 fast food workers, according to estimates, more than any state in the US. The bill, whose regulations would be limited to fast food restaurants with at least 30 franchises across the US, passed in the California Assembly on 31 January and is awaiting a vote in the Senate. But the bill faces strong opposition from groups who argue the proposal would grant the council too much power. The bill â€œjust drives entire franchises and franchise brands away from California,â€<9d> Republican assemblyman Kelly Seyarto told the Associated Press. Democratic assemblyman Chris Holden, a former franchisee himself, told the AP the bill gives the state â€œa chance to lead the country and address outstanding issues in the fast food industryâ€<9d>. â€œIt is about fairness and it is about bringing all the responsible parties to the table to collaborate on solutions.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

It comes after Ukraine said on Wednesday its military struck the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles, while distracting its crew with a drone, causing it to start sinking and forcing the crew of 500 to abandon ship. The Russian defense ministry said on Thursday: â€œThe cruiser ship Moskva lost its stability when it was towed to the port because of the damage to the shipâ€™s hull that it received during the fire from the detonation of ammunition. In stormy sea conditions, the ship sank.â€<9d> Is Russiaâ€™s claim about a â€œstormâ€<9d> true? The claim of bad weather being a factor was questioned by observers. â€œLooking at the weather report outside of Sevastopol today the winds were about 4 mph with 40-degree [4C] temperatures and a little bit of rain,â€<9d> the former commanding general of the US army in Europe told CNN. Whatâ€™s the significance? The sinking of the Moskva â€“ the pride of its fleet and the most prestigious vessel involved in the war against Ukraine â€“ represents a symbolic blow to the Kremlin. What could this mean for Russian strategy? The CIA director, William Burns, warned of â€œdesperationâ€<9d> from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who could resort to using a tactical or low-yield nuclear weapon as a result of his countryâ€™s military setbacks. Russia warns of nuclear weapons in Baltic if Sweden and Finland join Nato Moscow has said it will be forced to strengthen its defenses in the Baltic if Finland and Sweden join Nato, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Finland and Sweden are deliberating over whether to abandon decades of military non-alignment to join Nato, with the two Nordic countriesâ€™ leaders saying Russiaâ€™s onslaught on Ukraine has changed Europeâ€™s â€œwhole security landscapeâ€<9d>. Lithuania played down the threat, saying Russia already has nuclear weapons in its Baltic Kaliningrad enclave. That claim has not been independently verified. What should we expect next as the war enters its seventh week? Ukraine is braced for a powerful attack in the east. What sanctions is Volodymyr Zelenskiy calling for? The Ukrainian president this week has been urging the west for greater sanctions such as to stop buying all Russian oil. He also wants diplomats to return to Kyiv. Former British citizen convicted in â€˜Beatlesâ€™ Islamic state kidnapping trial by US jury A member of an Islamic state group that beheaded American hostages in Iraq and Syria, nicknamed the Beatles for their British accents, has been found guilty in a US court of terrorism offences. A jury found El Shafee Elsheikh, a 33-year-old former British citizen, guilty on all eight counts after a trial in Alexandria, Virginia. The jury deliberated for four hours before reaching its verdict in the most significant prosecution of an Islamic State member in the US. Elsheikh stood motionless and gave no visible reaction as the verdict was read. He faces up to a life sentence in prison. What was he charged with? Elsheikh was charged with hostage-taking, conspiracy to murder US citizens â€“ journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller â€“ and supporting a terrorist organisation. Did the survivors identify him? No. Although the Beatles had distinctive accents â€“ survivors identified them as John, George and Ringo â€“ they always took great care to hide their faces.

Has that message been heard? The second of four parts of the IPCCâ€™s sixth assessment report, the latest comprehensive review of our knowledge of the climate crisis, was termed by some scientists â€œthe bleakest warning yetâ€<9d>. Half of the worldâ€™s people are â€œhighly vulnerableâ€<9d> to serious impacts from the climate crisis, a billion people in coastal areas face inundation, mass die-offs of species including trees and coral have already begun, and close to a tenth of the worldâ€™s farmland is set to become unsuitable for agriculture. By any standards, these are stark and brutal findings. AntÃ³nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, said: â€œI have seen many scientific reports in my time, but nothing like this. Todayâ€™s IPCC report is an atlas of human suffering, and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership.â€<9d> But the report has been overshadowed, understandably, by the war in Ukraine, and has received less policymaker and media attention than it deserved. That does not mean the IPCC report will be ignored. Governments are working on their responses to the scientistsâ€™ warnings, and later this year at the next UN climate summit, Cop27, they are obliged to lay out their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Will Cop27 be affected by the war in Ukraine? Cop27 is to be held this November in Egypt, a country that has forged strong diplomatic and economic ties with Russia in the recent past. Any meetings among the G20 major economies will also take place under the shadow of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, insiders point out that the climate negotiations have gone on for 30 years, despite wars and other conflicts among UN nations. Climate diplomats are practised at keeping other geopolitical tensions at least partly at bay. Perhaps of even greater relevance to the climate crisis will be the decisions governments make on energy policy in response to the Ukraine war. This week, the International Energy Agency urged a suite of actions â€“ from households turning down their thermostats by 1C to windfall taxes on energy companies and the rapid construction of new wind and solar power generation â€“ that could reduce the EUâ€™s reliance on Russian gas by a third or more. The other options open to policymakers if Vladimir Putin turns off gas supplies to Europe would include a return to coal-fired power generation, the dirtiest form of fossil fuel. The choices that governments make now, ahead of next winter, will have profound consequences for the climate crisis. What actions could and should governments take as a direct result of the IPCC report? One of the key messages of the IPCC working group 2 report is that climate change is already occurring, all over the world. Even if we succeed in limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C, the limit countries agreed to target at Cop26 in Glasgow last November, we will still face more extreme weather, droughts, floods, heatwaves and sea level rises. The IPCC made clear that countries must seek to adapt now to these changes, to stave off the worst damage. Adaptation can mean building seawalls and river barriers, planting trees on hillsides to stop landslips amid floods, conserving or regrowing mangrove swamps to absorb the impact of coastal storm surges, painting roofs white to reflect the sunâ€™s heat, or making buildings and built infrastructure such as telecommunications networks, roads and railways more resilient to extreme weather. Far too little effort has gone into adaptation up to now, the IPCC found. Rich countries promised last year at Cop26 to double their funding for adaptation in the poor world, but nearly all countries are still badly prepared. Will adaptation be enough? No. There are â€œhard limitsâ€<9d> to adaptation, the IPCC made clear: the impacts of temperatures rising unchecked would overcome all our efforts to adjust. Flood barriers may hold back a river in spate today, but as the icecaps and glaciers melt, as heatwaves take hold, and as droughts threaten agriculture, we will face too many threats and they will grow too severe for any adaptation effort to allow life to proceed as normal. Cutting greenhouse gas emissions urgently, to stop temperatures rising further, must still be the priority, according to the IPCC. How should that be done? Early next month, the IPCC will release the third part of its four-part assessment, by working group 3, covering â€œmitigationâ€<9d> â€“ the ways in which countries can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This includes renewable energy generation, energy efficiency, alternatives to fossil fuels such as nuclear power, and novel technologies, such as carbon capture and storage and direct air capture of carbon dioxide. Working group 3 will set out pathways and policy choices governments could take to reach the goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C, including some of the likely costs and economic benefits of those choices. After that, a â€œsynthesis reportâ€<9d> drawing together all three parts of the IPCCâ€™s sixth assessment will be published in October, for policymakers to discuss at Cop27.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Itâ€™s wrong | Torsten Bell","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/20/forget-all-youve-heard-about-working-life-in-modern-britain-its-wrong","https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/20/forget-all-youve-heard-about-working-life-in-modern-britain-its-wrong","Economic change is speeding up. Technology means that industries are shrinking and growing faster than ever. The young change jobs incessantly while firms fire at will, ending the â€œjob for lifeâ€<9d> enjoyed by previous generations. Everyone moves around the country for work these days, vacating poorer parts of Britain and hollowing out communities. All of these statements are almost universally accepted as truths about 21st-century Britain. They guide what policymakers see as the important questions to be asked and the right answers to give. However, all of them are wrong, in many cases wildly so. In most senses, change has been flat or is actually slowing down. A safe option for anyone needing to sell an economics book for the past decade is to put a robot on the cover and warn that machines are taking our jobs and whole sectors are set to be wiped out â€“ from taxi drivers to lawyers. History shows us that big structural changes do happen. There were 7.7m manufacturing jobs in 1970 and there are only 2.5m today. The share of jobs in professional services, education and health has doubled over the same period. However, this kind of economic change, where the workforce shifts from one industry to another, has been slowing since the 1980s. In the 2010s, it was running at just one-third of the pace seen 30 years earlier because Britainâ€™s de-industrialisation is broadly complete. More recent trends, such as the decline of retail jobs and growth in the care sector, are minor in comparison and industrial change is actually at its lowest rate for a century. Economy-wide trends can hide what happens to individuals, but there too the evidence points in the opposite direction to popular narratives. A job-hopping epidemic is something managers moan about rather than a thing that actually happens. In 1993, the average time that workers had been in their post was 60 months. Almost three decades later, itâ€™s still 60 months. Nostalgia is a dangerous guide to just about anything â€“ there never was a job for life. The UK has a flexible labour market, where itâ€™s easy for workers to move or firms to hire and fire. But that doesnâ€™t mean lots of moving or firing is going on. The rates at which people change jobs is actually down by a full quarter this century with only 2.4% of us moving during the three months prior to the pandemic. The fall is particularly large for those workers held to be most likely to move: the young. We have seen a growth in less secure work, from zero-hours contracts to self-employment, but firms are much less likely to fire these days. In the late 1990s, 0.8% of workers would lose their jobs each quarter; immediately pre-pandemic that had halved. Modern business has nothing in common with The Apprentice. More young adults in university means more moving away from home for education. However, when it comes to young people moving around the country for work, that is now less common, down a third from the late 1990s to the late 2010s. More broadly, odd ideas about exactly who moves around the country are widespread. Take discussions of the so-called red wall seats that the Conservatives won at the last general election. Youâ€™d think from how people talk about the likes of Bolton and Ashfield that these constituencies have seen a youth exodus but their defining feature is that far fewer young people leave them than depart other, richer, Conservative seats â€“ and for that matter, far fewer people are moving in. This huge gap between rhetoric and reality on economic change matters. It focuses our attention on the wrong problems and drives us to the wrong answers, taking our politics down rabbit holes that do nothing to help us build a better Britain. Worries about too much change distract us from the real disaster of the past decade: our pay and productivity levels have not changed nearly enough. Before the financial crisis, productivity grew at roughly 2% a year. Since then, it has averaged only 0.4%, resulting in our wages having only just recovered to their pre-financial crisis level when Covid turned up. Those making fewer job moves, particular younger workers, have missed out on significant pay rises: individuals who moved job typically enjoy five times the pay rise of workers staying put. The young arenâ€™t too footloose and fancy free - theyâ€™re dangerously stuck in the mud. Far from all change is good, of course. The decline in job losses means fewer people now see the downgrades and falls in pay that often follow. Instead of panicking about jobs being destroyed, we should focus on the fact that different groups face very different risks: lower-paid workers are six times more likely than managers to lose work. They are the ones under threat from the Cameron-era decision to only give workers protection from unfair dismissal after two years in post. Recognition that workers are now less likely to move for a new job has important lessons for us that are obscured by misplaced panic about everyone moving around the country. This is happening for a mixture of good (there are now far fewer places where people have to leave if they want to find work), bad (housing costs rise faster in higher wage areas and put better paid jobs out of reach for many) and important reasons, such as wanting to remain near family, that policy must reinforce, tackle and understand respectively. Finally, understanding that our recent past has not involved significant economic change should warn us that we may not be well prepared if that rate of change speeds up. Pent-up desire for change during the pandemic has pushed job moves temporarily to record highs, while the lasting consequences of the home-working surge remain to be seen. The aftermath of Covid-19 and the rate at which our population is ageing could combine with Brexit and the net-zero transition to reshape our economy over the decade ahead. If they do, itâ€™ll be a shock to Britainâ€™s workers, companies and the state. Our benefits system without its furlough bolt-on does little to insure us against change, while corporate Britain has a weak record on investing when new opportunities and challenges emerge. Watching Apollo 11â€™s 1969 triumph in taking humans to the moon was a formative experience for my dad. Whenever heâ€™s told technological change has accelerated, he notes that itâ€™s taken us another 50 years for Amazon to get William Shatner into space. He has a point, which is as true for economic change here on Earth as it is for travel to the stars. â€¢ Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.

While skiers scramble to secure packages to the famous mega-resorts, there are dozens of smaller, lesser-known ski villages that offer excellent value for money while combining thrilling skiing with old-time charm and glorious natural surroundings. Here are a few that offer a change of scene and pace. Hauteluce, Savoie You would hardly know this traditional farming village, tightly clustered around a tall baroque church spire, was a ski resort. There are no big hotels or pylons, but one chairlift discreetly rises from the back of the village, connecting to the Espace Diamant, a surprisingly large ski area given its low profile, with 192km of runs across six resort villages. Lying at 1,150 metres in the Beaufortain region with epic views of Mont Blanc, Hauteluce has an â€œeco museumâ€<9d> displaying historic objects from everyday life. Nearby is the smart La Ferme du Chozal hotel (doubles from â‚¬175 a night room-only, six-person apartments from â‚¬1,600 per week) with spa and restaurant. Valloire, Savoie The traditional Alpine town of Valloire is famous as a point on the classic Tour de France route between the Col du TÃ©lÃ©graphe and the Col du Galibier â€“ one of the highest passes in the cycle race. Itâ€™s less well known as a ski resort, but the sport has grown a lot here over the years and benefits from a link to the modern resort of Valmeinier, together creating a varied ski area of 150km of pistes across the Maurienne valley. The RÃ©sidence Odalys le Hameau (from â‚¬405 per week sleeping four), just 10 metres from the slopes, has simple self-catering apartments and an indoor pool. Saint-VÃ©ran, Hautes-Alpes Many smaller ski resorts lie at a lower altitude than the big hitters, but not so Saint-VÃ©ran in the unspoilt Queyras valley, which sits at 2,040 metres and stakes a claim to be the highest (and, they say, the most beautiful) village in France. Situated in glorious Queyras regional natural park and known primarily as a place for enthusiastic ski tourers to get into the backcountry, it also has a small network of lifts for downhill skiers. Try the Chalets du Villard, whose rooms and separate gÃ®tes have access to a sauna and restaurant (studio rooms from â‚¬102 per night sleeping two or â‚¬160 sleeping four, room only; gÃ®tes from â‚¬465 per week sleeping four). BarÃ¨ges, French PyrenÃ©es Among 40 ski resorts across the French PyrenÃ©es, the high mountain town of BarÃ¨ges is an excellent choice, noted for its thermal waters and proximity to the Grand Tourmalet ski area, the regionâ€™s largest, which also incorporates La Mongie. Freeriding on the 2,877-metre Pic du Midi, with 10km of descent, is a big draw, though itâ€™s almost as fun to ride the cable car up to the top just for a cappuccino on the sun terrace. Balneotherapy centres provide relaxing immersion in the famous waters, while kids might prefer an igloo-building lesson. The recently revamped 13-room Hotel le Central (doubles from â‚¬75 a night, room only) has a pool and handy in-house ski hire and servicing. Pays de Gex, Monts Jura A good all-round resort for a variety of snow-bound activities, Pays de Gex connects four characterful ski areas in the Monts Jura mountain range, 30 minutesâ€™ drive from Geneva and covered under one ski pass costing a bargainous Â£19 a day. Thereâ€™s great diversity among them: challenging LÃ©lex-Crozet has a vertical drop of 800 metres, Mijoux-La Faucille offers dreamy cruising, MenthiÃ¨res has family runs, while 160km of cross-country tracks wind through the Domaine de la Vattay. Be sure to try bleu de Gex-Haut Jura, the local blue cheese. And consider HÃ´tel-Restaurant Bois Joly in Crozet, with magnificent balcony views and serving traditional fare featuring morilles, marrons and escargots. A seven-night stay costs from Â£506 for two people room only, booking.com Aravis valley, Savoie/Haute-Savoie The Aravis valley resorts of La Clusaz, Manigod, Saint-Jean-de-Sixt and Le Grand-Bornand are a serious option for skiers of all levels, linked by ski bus, with 230km of varied runs between them. La Clusaz is a good all-rounder with some gnarly off-piste on the Massif de Balme. Manigodâ€™s woodland learner slopes are lovely for first-timers, while Le Grand-Bornand suits intermediates, with some black runs. The area excels when it comes to unusual extracurricular activities, too, such as a 7km night-time sledge run by torchlight or twilight fat-tyred e-bike descent in Le Grand-Bornand. All are easy to reach from Aravis Lodge (three nightsâ€™ half-board from Â£429pp, skiweekender.com), a chalet-hotel with sauna which runs a free shuttle bus. MontgenÃ¨vre, Hautes-Alpes This snow-sure resort on the French-Italian border lies at one end of the Milky Way ski area, where its own 60km of slopes are extended to 400km under the Grand MontgenÃ¨vre ski pass, which also covers the Italian resorts of Pragelato, Sestriere, Cesana, Sansicario and Sauze dâ€™Oulx; the two countriesâ€™ cultures mix here. MontgenÃ¨vre has two boardercross courses, and some folk make day trips to the extreme off-piste resort of La Grave an hour away. Try Le Napoleonâ€™s modern collection of self-catering apartments, with shared access to an indoor pool, hammam and sauna. A seven-night self-drive package costs from Â£420pp including Eurotunnel crossing with Ski Solutions Sainte Foy, Savoie Increasing numbers of skiing families are cottoning on to Sainte Foy, north of the Tarentaiseâ€™s Vanoise national park, as a fantastic alternative to its lively neighbours of Valdâ€™IsÃ¨re and Tignes. Gorgeous cruisy runs funnel down into the valley, making it hard to get lost, while experienced riders and skiers can discover awesome off-piste lines in the backcountry by hiring a guide when conditions are right. Peak Retreats has seven-nightsâ€™ self-catering at the centrally located Etoile des Cimes Sainte Foy Ski Apartments (from Â£656pp per week including Eurotunnel crossing), which has an indoor pool and spa Pralognan-la-Vanoise, Savoie One of the lesser-known resorts among 110 that are spread through the Savoie Mont Blanc region, Pralognan-la-Vanoise is only one valley over from Courchevel but a world away in terms of cost and atmosphere. This underappreciated gem in the Parc de la Vanoise combines decent downhill (10 reds, four blacks, 10 greens, five blues) with beautiful terrain for snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. One of Franceâ€™s few curling rinks is open for visitors here, or try cold Toumo yoga, which originated in Tibet and is performed outdoors in the snow and glacial rivers. Hotel Edelweiss, with spa, sauna and gym, became the resortâ€™s first four-star this season (from â‚¬980 per week B&amp;B sleeping two, five course dinner â‚¬35pp). Or self-cater in an apartment at Les Hauts de la Vanoise (from Â£500 per week sleeping four). GÃ©rardmer, Vosges For those whose idea of a winter break involves lots of cosy time padding around a timber cabin watching snowflakes, rather than hammering the sort of pistes you see on Ski Sunday, this might be the one. A 10-minute drive from GÃ©rardmer, whose ski area has 21 runs, night skiing and 30km of cross-country ski trails, is Vosges Cabin, a modern minimalist refuge in a nature reserve in the Vosges mountains. The owner describes the area as more akin to Germanyâ€™s Black Forest than the Alps, and the cabin features huge box windows for gazing out at woodland and sparkling Lac du GÃ©rardmer, as well as a hot tub and sauna. Sleeps up to 16 in five en suite bedrooms and a bunk room, from â‚¬200-â‚¬450 a night depending on numbers, welcomebeyond.com",FALSE,"pillar/lifestyle","Lifestyle"

Mayoâ€™s is his spare bedroom, which boasts some excellent wallpaper featuring graphic versions of 7in singles. â€œEvery single record label and band and identifying mark has been removed,â€<9d> he notes. â€œBut if youâ€™re a veteran like I am, you can spot a Fontana single or a CPS or Epicâ€¦â€<9d> Kermode is in a teeny room in a house he moved into only yesterday. Unsurprisingly, his is not a fabulous backdrop (unpacked boxes and what looks like a bunk bed) but somehow, heâ€™s managed to make his computer camera reveal him in moody black and white. â€œOh God, how did I do that? I canâ€™t switch it off now,â€<9d> he says. â€œVery Bait,â€<9d> comments Mayo, dryly. Teasing and bickering with a film (and, often, music) theme is what Kermode and Mayo do, and have done since the 1990s, when Kermode first appeared in a film review slot on Mayoâ€™s Radio 1 morning show. When Mayo decamped, first to 5 Live and then to Radio 2, their on-air relationship continued as Kermode and Mayoâ€™s Film Review, a two-hour 5 Live Friday afternoon radio show and podcast. Even after Mayoâ€™s rather tetchy 2018 departure from Radio 2 (he was put into a difficult co-hosting position with Jo Whiley; he left after six months), Kermode and Mayoâ€™s Film Review remained exactly where it was, providing informed, jolly, â€œwhat to go and see this weekendâ€<9d> entertainment. Or â€œwittertainmentâ€<9d>, as the showâ€™s fans have it. And there are many, many fans. (We received hundreds of questions for this feature.) One of the BBCâ€™s first ever podcasts, Kermode and Mayoâ€¦ has long been one of its most popular. It won Listenersâ€™ Choice at the British podcast awards in 2017 and 2018, and has avid, communicative listeners as well as an impressive interviewee list of high-profile directors and actors, many of whom have returned to the show several times. All respond to the wit, honesty and knowledge of the hosts. Mayo does the celebrity interviews (excellent: light but informed); Kermode provides the critical opinions (likewise, but more passionate: they occasionally turn into rants). No prying into famous peopleâ€™s personal lives: the chat is entirely work-based, though this often morphs into running jokes, about cinema etiquette, or Jason Isaacs, or anything else film-esque they alight on for a time. The key to the show is: both men love film and they get on with each other. Kermode and Mayoâ€™s Film Review seemed utterly embedded, part of the BBCâ€™s fixtures and fittings, until March this year, when the pair announced their departure. Perhaps it was always coming, given the way that Mayo had been treated. â€œWe both had a very nice email from the director general, thanking us for our service, and how much heâ€™d enjoyed the programme, and Iâ€™m in the process of working out what to say in reply, which is basically, â€˜Thanks very much,â€™â€<9d> Mayo says, diplomatically. So theyâ€™ve left, and have taken a few weeks off, and when they return, on Friday, it will be in podcast form, as Kermode &amp; Mayoâ€™s Take. This will come out twice a week, and thereâ€™ll also be a spin-off show, Take 2, for paying subscribers (which sounds like more of the same, but with no celebs and more listener contributions). So what can we expect from these new podcasts? â€œWell, you catch us in the interregnum between the BBC and the glorious new future,â€<9d> says Mayo, â€œand we havenâ€™t actually done anything yet. Itâ€™s hard to say too much, other than, essentially, although there will be exciting differences, itâ€™s Mark and me talking about films, and talking to actors and directors, and reading emails. We only have one way of operating.â€<9d> The big difference appears to be that they will be reviewing TV shows as well as films, but, insists Kermode, this isnâ€™t a major new feature. â€œTo be clear, Iâ€™m a film critic whoâ€™ll happen to be watching some television,â€<9d> he says. â€œNeither of us are pretending to step on the very great shoes of the people who review TV professionally.â€<9d> â€œTen years ago,â€<9d> says Mayo, â€œthere was cinema and there was television. And now, thereâ€™s so much cross-fertilisation that the TV shows will be obvious, I think. The ones that our audience would hope that we will tackle. Not, say, a new EastEnders story.â€<9d> If theyâ€™d been on recently, they would have discussed The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe, or Ron Howardâ€™s documentary about Paradise in California. Theyâ€™ll definitely be all over Danny Boyleâ€™s Sex Pistols series: â€œClearly heâ€™s a fascinating guest and the Sex Pistols are a fascinating subject,â€<9d> says Mayo. â€œAnd it means I can sing Danny Boyle to the tune of Danny Boy,â€<9d> says Kermode. It does seem that, despite the podcasts being a new venture, much will stay the same. Kermode, naturally more passionate, will still be effusing and dismissing; Mayo, more acerbic, but also more reasonable, will continue to present more mainstream opinion. Plus theyâ€™re bringing their 5 Live production team with them, and theyâ€™ll record together, in the same room, which they much prefer to Zooming, as they did during lockdown. â€œIt lasted for about a year,â€<9d> says Kermode. â€œAnd the minute we got back in the studio together, it was so much easier. The way you talk to each other is completely different. So much of the communication is to do with me looking at him and him not looking at meâ€¦â€<9d> Of course, they have other jobs: Mayoâ€™s radio hosting sees him on air six days a week, for Scala and Greatest Hits Radio; Kermode writes reviews for this paper and talks film for various outlets. But you get the sense that being together, discussing movies every week, is an anchor for them. Or maybe a seesaw â€“ a toy that doesnâ€™t work without the other being there. â€œItâ€™s true,â€<9d> says Kermode. â€œWherever we are, whatever weâ€™re doing, weâ€™ll be two old blokes in a room talking, with some films in between.â€<9d> Thandiwe Newton, actor Who are your favourite three female directors, each? Mark Kermode: Current female directors? Carol Morley, because her films are brilliantly adventurous. Iâ€™ve had so much pleasure watching her films, and marvelling at all the many things that are going on. Iâ€™ve watched Out of Blue three times back to back, and every time I watched it I saw new things in it. My favourite female director currently working is CÃ©line Sciamma. Girlhood was so brilliant, and not only did she have those great performances and that great milieu that you believed in, but the film landed at exactly the right moment when everyone was going: â€œOh, wow, itâ€™s raising all these issues.â€<9d> And I love Petite Maman, my favourite film of last year, just perfect. Then Julia Ducournau, because I thought Raw, followed by Titane wasâ€¦ Simon Mayo: She has sex with a car, Mark. Come onâ€¦ MK: When I saw Raw, I remember finishing my review saying: â€œThe world is her oyster, watch her swallow it whole.â€<9d> And then Titane came along, and it was like, boom. That rush of excitement and energy, you can feel her getting her fingernails dirty. Iâ€™d also add Joanna Hogg. I love her films. SM: She didnâ€™t have sex in a car, she had sex with a carâ€¦ I would add Kathryn Bigelow. What Mark says, plus Kathryn Bigelow. How did you meet and what were your first impressions of each other? Hazel, Dublin SM: I had just moved off breakfast to do mornings on Radio 1. And Matthew Bannister had taken over as controller, and I remember saying to him: â€œI think film reviews would be a good part of the show.â€<9d> He said: â€œWell, Markâ€™s doing this for Mark and Lard. Why donâ€™t you try him out?â€<9d> So we had a rehearsal and it all went splendidly. When it comes to first impressions, I just thought it was a very good five minutes of radio. MK: I remember going: â€œThatâ€™s Simon Mayo off Top of the Pops!â€<9d> Jason Isaacs, actor Your show is an island of joy in increasingly dark times. I know that both of you are avid consumers of news and politics, so how do you manage to find ways to project optimism? SM: Iâ€™ve never heard us described as an island of joy before! Speaking for myself, Iâ€™d say thereâ€™s an element of performance in most radio. And it is a pretty dark time, but you donâ€™t want an entertainment show to make you feel even worse. Which is not to say that we donâ€™t deal with some very serious topics, either ones that come out of the moviesâ€™ subject material, or the stuff people write to us about, which is births, marriages, deaths, the final words that their father said to them before he died. But I think we have an obligation to give people an entertaining couple of hours. MK: The genius thing about the show is, I talk to Simon, and Simon talks to the audience. The joy and the optimism, that all comes from Simon. I donâ€™t really understand how it works. I just say the first thing that comes into my head. A lot of the time they have to birdsong it. Are you continuing the birdsong in the new show? SM: I think the editorial line will stay the same as it has always been. Cursing will get birdsong. The political bias from the Trot over the way, that will get birdsong. It is, and it will always be, a programme that you can listen to with your kids and with your grandpa. What is your respective home-viewing setup? Ephraim Muller, via Twitter MK: Iâ€™ve got a fairly big flat television with a soundbar with a subwoofer. SM: More or less the same, but I havenâ€™t got a soundbar or a subwoofer. What about your sofas? Because thatâ€™s important. MK: I sit on an armchair, because there is an armchair, and I donâ€™t know how this happened, but it became Dadâ€™s armchair. Even if Iâ€™m in on my own, and there is a lovely sofa that I could enjoy, Iâ€™m in the armchair. The dogâ€™s allowed on the sofa, but Iâ€™m not. SM: Iâ€™m in the armchair, but mine is a chair without arms. It has a supportive cushion. Kenneth Branagh, actor and director Which are the films on which you have passionately disagreed? MK: I can answer this. When I left Radio 1, at my leaving do, I did a screening of Dougal and the Blue Cat, one of my favourite films of all time. Mayo came along, and you have never seen somebody hate a film so much. Weâ€™ve also disagreed about two films that he has never seen, and that he will never see, which is The Exorcist, which Simon wonâ€™t see because itâ€™s my favourite film of all time, and he thinks it gets funnier every year that he wonâ€™t see it. And Jeremy, the film that I first fell in love with, because he once heard the theme tune and thought it was terrible, and therefore on principle wonâ€™t watch it. SM: Iâ€™m very happy to see The Exorcist, but it seems to be more useful as a running jokeâ€¦ The film that absolutely fell right into this is the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, which I enjoyed and Mark hated. And for about a year, it was a running joke that weâ€™d ask every guest: â€œDid you like Pirates of the Caribbean?â€<9d> Most people liked it. MK: Iâ€™d like to point out, the people who thought they liked it, didnâ€™t like it. They just thought they liked it until I explained to them why they didnâ€™t. And therein is the role of a critic. SM: No, thatâ€™s the role of a Marxist. MK: Iâ€™m not a Marxist. Iâ€™m a bleeding heart, middle-class liberal. What would be your Mastermind specialist subjects if you couldnâ€™t choose film or music? Mike Searle, Surrey MK: I want to say absolutely solidly, that I would never do Mastermind. Stuart Maconie did Mastermind, and he was brilliant. Not just amazing general knowledge, but amazing general knowledge available to him in the moment. If I said: â€œOK, my specialist subject will be Elvis, or The Exorcist,â€<9d> and they asked me who wrote The Exorcist, or what was Elvisâ€™s middle name, Iâ€™d blank. I would be unable to remember my own name. SM: I have refused to be on Mastermind for the same reasons. But in the spirit of the question, I would choose either Edmund Burkeâ€™s Theory of Revolution, which is what I did at university, or the War of 1812, which I studied a lot when I wrote a book a couple of years ago. Ashley Walters, actor What is the formula for a great movie? MK: So I would say, as a critic â€“ and bear in mind critics do not know how to make films, they only know how to watch them â€“ the only thing that works is the thing that I didnâ€™t see coming. I go to screenings on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday every week, and itâ€™s like, 10 oâ€™clock, one oâ€™clock, three oâ€™clock starts. I donâ€™t know anything about the films Iâ€™m seeing, because I tend not to read stuff in advance. Sometimes I donâ€™t even know the name of the film. I turn up, and I have no idea what it is, then it turns out to be film of the week. Because it surprises you. SM: My honest starting point is, there is no formula. Obviously, it helps if thereâ€™s a great script, and your actors can act. But thatâ€™s sometimes not enough. So I donâ€™t know what the answer is, and I suspect that a lot of directors might say the same. MK: Can I add one thing to this, which is: I would always rather watch a film aim high and fail on its own terms, than succeed in some botched way. Maybe, if there is a formula, itâ€™s that. Itâ€™s why films like Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, which crashed and burned when it opened, is now considered to be Lynchâ€™s best work, because it is what it is. Which actor do you think has produced the greatest quality of work across their career? Ben Hoeksma, Windsor MK: Kate Dickie. She is the most consistently brilliant actor I can think of. Iâ€™ve seen her in every manner of film, and I have never, ever seen her give less than 100%. When you look at her filmography, itâ€™s astonishing. I think Kate Dickieâ€™s screen career is the thing that you could hold up in front of movie actors and go: â€œThat is doing the job properly.â€<9d> And yet you can watch three Kate Dickie films in succession on the same day and not realise youâ€™re watching the same person. She is the very definition of the thing that in America they call â€œcharacter actorsâ€<9d>. And here we call â€œactorsâ€<9d>. SM: I remember interviewing Pete Postlethwaite a few years ago, and looking at his filmography, which was just astonishing. He was in everything, he was in almost every film that came out in one particular year. And two people who have appeared on the show a lot: Eddie Marsan, first. If Eddie is in it, whether the film is great or not, he is going to be great. And Toby Jones. In terms of a body of work, both of those you would go, extraordinary. MK: Eddie Marsan told me that the day after he finished Happy-Go-Lucky he went to America to do Hancock. Literally one minute he was going â€œEnraha!â€<9d> in the street with Mike Leigh [from a much-quoted scene of Marsan playing an angry driving instructor], the next day he was trying to kill Will Smith with a rocket launcher. Edgar Wright, director I am passionate to the point of being evangelical about the benefits of seeing films on the big screen. How do you feel about the big-screen experience today? And whatâ€™s your best experience of seeing a film with an audience? MK: I feel very positive about the big-screen experience. Even if something is available for somebody to watch on their television, a good number of people will still go and watch it in a cinema. Look at the number of people that went to see that Russell Crowe-in-a-truck film, because, â€œHey, cinemas are open and Russell Croweâ€™s in a truck!â€<9d> As for the best experience of seeing things with an audience, when we saw Gaspar NoÃ©â€™s IrrÃ©versible at the Edinburgh film festival, the guy in front of me fainted and I had to carry him out of the auditorium. I was so thrilled! And somebody fainted when one of the Chapman brothers and I did a screening of Possession, the Andrzej Å»uÅ‚awski film. And then, of course, a very good friend of mine fainted when I saw The Exorcist at the Barnet Odeon in the 80s. You just want to be in some darkened room with people passing out. MK: With people being so overwhelmed by the film, that they literally leave their body. SM: I have no desire to see those films. But I entirely agree about the big-screen experience. There are some movies that you just have to see in the cinema, like a new James Bond. The answer to the second part is seeing One Flew Over the Cuckooâ€™s Nest at Warwick University film society, in a science lecture theatre. Like being in a Methodist chapel: hard surfaces, no confectionery, no alcohol consumed. But at the end of the movie, not only did it get applause from everybody, some people stood up and applauded. Can Mark tell his Harvey Keitel story? Luke, Stockport MK: OK, so the Harvey Keitel story doesnâ€™t exist. It was just nothing that became something through repetition. I said at one point: â€œOh, itâ€™s so libellous that you couldnâ€™t possibly repeat it, but if you stop me in the street, Iâ€™ll tell it to you.â€<9d> And then people did stop me in the street. And then I said: â€œOK, there isnâ€™t a story. But if somebody asks you, tell them â€˜I couldnâ€™t possibly repeat it.â€™â€<9d> It does cut to something at the heart of the show, which is, we always struggle to remember where the running jokes came from. Which film would world leaders most benefit from seeing and learning the messages from? Leigh, China MK: Mary Poppins, because itâ€™s a good film about goodness. SM: Well, if Putin is in the audience, The Great Dictator would be a good place to start, and then we could all turn around and look at him and go: â€œThatâ€™s you.â€<9d> SM: And then when he was emotionally vulnerable, play A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, which is about goodness and cardigans. Rather than being topless on a horse. If you were a biscuit, what sort would you be and why? Lady_Geoffery, Bristol SM: I would like to think that Iâ€™m a chocolate digestive, but I suspect Iâ€™m just a digestive. Sort of reassuringly wholesome. MK: Iâ€™m a ginger snap. Because theyâ€™re familiar, but they break in an unpleasant way. Carol Morley, director Itâ€™s not possible youâ€™ve collaborated this long and never had a dream about each other. So whatâ€™s the best dream youâ€™ve had about the other? SM: I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve had one. MK: I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever had a dream about you, and now Iâ€™m actually feeling guilty about that. But if Carol wants to make a film about the dreams we have about each other, Iâ€™d happily watch it. I read Simonâ€™s book Knife Edge, and I thought it would make a good movie. Who would Simon cast in the lead role of Famie Madden? Who would Mark have direct it? Jonny Cole, New Forest SM: It was just a person who I was imagining when I wrote it, but the answer is Gemma Arterton. Although Famie is slightly older than Gemma. I would definitely cast her. MK: For director, Iâ€™d say somebody like Aneil Karia, because I remember when The Long Goodbye came out and Simon said: â€œYou have to see this thing, itâ€™s just amazing.â€<9d> And then they just won an Oscar, which got lost in all the nonsense. SM: Actually, Aneil was slated to direct Mad Blood Stirring [another Mayo book], and then he wrote to me explaining why he couldnâ€™t do itâ€¦ If it ends up anywhere, it will be television, the rights have been bought. Clio Barnard, director Which film changed your life? MK: Krakatoa, East of Java. It was the film that I remember seeing first in the cinema. My mother took me. And though I remember very little about it other than a massive volcano, and a song-and-dance number on a boat, honestly, that was the thing that made me think I want to spend the rest of my life in the cinema. I was absolutely overwhelmed. I only ever saw it once. Iâ€™d like to put Clio in my list of my favourite female film-makers too, incidentally. SM: In terms of that rocket fuel moment Mark is talking about... seeing Mary Poppins, the first movie I saw in a cinema when I was, like, six. We got the timings wrong, so I saw the second half first, and then we stayed, because it was on a continuous loop, so I saw the first half after that, out of sync. In terms of change: movies donâ€™t change your life. MK: They do. SM: They donâ€™t. MK: They do. Mark, do you think that in your relative old age, youâ€™re becoming slightly softer and more forgiving of bad films? Or do you feel thereâ€™s always a chance of another Entourage rant around the corner? Graham Hollingsworth, London MK: Nobody ever believes this, but I never, ever plan to rant about anything. Quite often, afterwards, I feel a bitâ€¦ ugh, you know? I think Iâ€™ve become more open-minded about what a film is trying to do, and more admiring of somebody trying to do something interesting. And less tolerant of films that arenâ€™t even trying. A rant can always come. SM: And the films that youâ€™re talking about are always films that arenâ€™t bad, they are offensive. The last time I interviewed Daniel Craig, the first thing he said was: â€œThat Entourage review went well, then?â€<9d> It was already like two years old or something. He said he was on a set and everyone gathered around and watched it, because it was a great piece of performance. In fact, Markâ€™s performance in the review of Entourageâ€¦ MK: â€¦was better than any of the performances in the film, boom tish. Asif Kapadia, director Who are your top five people that youâ€™ve interviewed on your 5 Live show? MK: Simon does the interviews, so shoot. SM: Asif is always a fantastic guest, by the way. He manages to engage you. If youâ€™re not interested in football, youâ€™ll still watch his Maradona doc... Off the top of my head, Tom Hanks. There is nobody who can sell a movie like Tom Hanks. Nobody. There should be a documentary made and shown to lesser actors. â€œThis is how you do promotion. Make the person youâ€™re talking to feel as though theyâ€™re the only person that youâ€™re going to talk to, and give a little bit more than theyâ€™re expecting.â€<9d> One time I was interviewing him, and I said to him: â€œWhat are you working on next?â€<9d> And he said: â€œWell, itâ€™s funny, the other day I was on the phone to Clint Eastwoodâ€¦â€<9d> and then he did a Clint Eastwood impression to round off the interview. So I would put Tom Hanks at one, two and three. Then the previously mentioned Sir Kenneth Branagh has to be in there, because he came in, live on the showâ€¦ MK: And chuckled. SM: Which is where Chuckles comes from, a nickname that he only has when heâ€™s on our show. He has the Hanksian gift. Whatever the merits of what heâ€™s talking about, you just feel genial towards him. So Iâ€™m going to go Tom Hanks one, two and three, Ken Branagh four, and Chadwick Boseman at number five. The last time we spoke to him was for 21 Bridges. And he gave an astonishing answer to a question about Martin Scorsese, who was perceived as being slightly rude about Marvel films. It was like a soliloquy, an extraordinary speech about believing in what he did, and believing in the uniqueness of Marvel and Black Panther specifically. It was so wonderful that when he died, we played that answer again as a tribute. Iâ€™m aware there are no women in that answer. MK: Amma Asante would be in that list. I hadnâ€™t met Amma when you interviewed her for Belle, and I sat there thinking: â€œThis is the smartest film-maker Iâ€™ve ever heard.â€<9d> Answers that were thought out and engaged, in beautifully formed whole sentences, with that incredible, almost broadcaster voice that she has. SM: So letâ€™s kick out one of the Hanks. MK: And then at number five, Charlie Kaufman. Amma Asanteâ€¦ â€¦is our next questioner, weirdly, and she asks: Which film character would each of you say most typifies the other? SM: Iâ€™d cast him in the Nick Lowe story in the title role. MK: Well, youâ€™d be A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, wouldnâ€™t you? Youâ€™d be Hanks doing Mr Rogers. Youâ€™d be him. Youâ€™d be the guy whoâ€™d go: â€œHello, everybody.â€<9d> SM: Iâ€™ve got a cardigan, look. But Simon has an anger underneath thereâ€¦ MK: Well, thereâ€™s an absolutely great scene in that film, in which Mr Rogers is angry about something, something has got under his skin, and you just see him take a moment. A tiny little gesture that speaks volumes. And the character was a brilliant broadcaster and Simon is a brilliant broadcaster. Whatâ€™s the closest youâ€™ve come to a proper falling out? Gerald Browne, Wetherby MK: The worst thatâ€™s ever happened would be that youâ€™ll say: â€œI need to do this on Wednesday.â€<9d> I go: â€œOK, thatâ€™s going to be very complicated. Can we not do it on Tuesday?â€<9d> Then some very polite text messages about which day it would be better to record a show on. When we go into that polite mode, thatâ€™s as bad as it gets. SM: I think it comes down to having very clearly defined roles on the programme. So in matters of films, I defer to Mark, because heâ€™s the critic. Iâ€™m the host, so I can give you a proper answer about whoâ€™s been a good guest to interview on the show. Thereâ€™s no jostling for the limelight. You have been very professional and diplomatic in what you have not said about the BBC, but from your lengthy experience working for the corporation, what one change would you make to sustain it for the future? Nick Taylor, Culcheth, Warrington SM: [Sighs, looks at the ceiling] Weâ€™re just presenters, I donâ€™t know. The BBC gets enough advice. MK: Iâ€™m still at the BBC, Iâ€™m still doing Screenshot on Radio 4 and Iâ€™m still doing the News Channel film review, and thereâ€™s an outside possibility that thereâ€™ll be another Secrets of Cinema. The only thing that I would say is, trust programme-makers a little bit more. In my experience, people who make programmes actually tend to know what theyâ€™re doing, and why theyâ€™re doing it. And they thrive with as little interference from on high as possible. SM: I would say probably the BBC has to do less, and to do the things that it does, better. Staff programmes properly. Donâ€™t make them scrimp and save and get them to work all the hours God sends just because the budget has been cut again. And that will mean thereâ€™ll be some areas that the BBC has to decide not to do. If I was still on 5 Live, and the director general had come on, I always had this question in mind: â€œHow many orchestras does the BBC need?â€<9d> Mike Leigh, director Whatâ€™s the worst truly bad film that you love? And whatâ€™s the best truly great film you hate? MK: Oh, wow. There are loads of bad films that I love. I would say probably the worst, truly bad in every version Iâ€™ve seen, is Caligula. Because I still have it in my head that somewhere in the ether, there is a version of Caligula that makes sense, and isnâ€™t just an absolute car crash. I love Malcolm McDowell in that film, his portrayal of Caligula is brilliant. The scenes with him and Helen Mirren are justâ€¦ So, Caligula. SM: The bad movie I really like is Patch Adams. And the entire reason for that is itâ€™s the only time I got to interview Robin Williams. And the apparently great film I donâ€™t like is definitely The Piano, which everyone tells me is sensational and is just rain in New Zealand. MK: Iâ€™d say the film I hate that other people love is Lars von Trierâ€™s The Idiots. I got thrown out of the screening at Cannes for heckling it. I shouted: â€œIl est merde! Il est le plus merde dans le monde entier,â€<9d> which is apparently not grammatically correct. Iâ€™ve actually loved other Von Trier stuff, Antichrist, and Melancholia. And Iâ€™ve interviewed him, and I said: â€œI have to tell you, I hated Breaking the Waves, and I hated The Idiots.â€<9d> And he said: â€œOK, but did you really hate them?â€<9d> And I said: â€œYes, I really hated them. And he said: â€œBut did you really hate them?â€<9d> I said: â€œYes, I really hated them.â€<9d> And he said: â€œGood. Then we can get on.â€<9d> Simon â€“ favourite ever Spurs player? Mark â€“ favourite bass player? Chris Moody, via Twitter SM: Osvaldo Ardiles. Going back to a time when footballers from abroad were very exciting, when Ricardo Villa and Osvaldo Ardiles from Argentina came to Spurs, it was front page of the Daily Mirror and their headline was Spurs Coup the World. Itâ€™s the kind of thing you remember. He was this wizard, brilliant genius in the midfield. MK: My favourite bassist is Jim Lea from Slade, because he was the first time I was aware of hearing the bass carrying the tune. He is an incredibly melodic bass player. One of my favourite rock films is Slade in Flame, which has got How Does It Feel as the theme tune. And the bass line just breaks my heart every time I hear it. SM: If Iâ€™m allowed a vote, Iâ€™d like to chip in with Jean-Jacques Burnel from the Stranglers. MK: Well then, Iâ€™m going to do my favourite Spurs player, which was Pat Jennings. SM: Good call. Biggest hands in football. Mark Strong, actor Please explain the â€œWith, And, Butâ€<9d> game. Will it now be consigned to history? SM: OK, well, the â€œWith, And, Butâ€<9d> game is Mark Strongâ€™s idea. So thatâ€™s rich coming from him. It was [actor]Tom Wilkinson who explained that you get your agent to ask for the â€œandâ€<9d> at the end of a list of actors in a film, so that itâ€™s â€œBig Star, Big Star, and Respected Starâ€<9d>. But it was Mark Strongâ€™s belief that sometimes these actors should have a â€œbutâ€<9d> before their name. MK: Itâ€™s amazing how well it works. And, of course, now there are different â€œandsâ€<9d>: â€œwith the special appearance ofâ€<9d>, â€œincluding the involvement ofâ€<9d>â€¦ SM: To be honest, we havenâ€™t done it for ages. But like all of these things, it will come around again, particularly as Mark thought of it, and we love Mark Strong. Do you ever fear that thinking so deeply about films actually detracts from the basic emotional experience of watching them? Jazmin Saville, London MK: No. The idea that if you unpack somethingâ€¦ thereâ€™s a lovely quote from Billy Bragg, out of Must I Paint You a Picture? Iâ€™m slightly misquoting it. â€œThe temptation/ To take the precious things we have apart/ To see how they work/ Must be resisted for they never fit together again.â€<9d> Itâ€™s a lovely idea that if you take something apart you canâ€™t put it back together again, but Iâ€™ve actually never found that with a film. SM: Overanalysing people or a relationship, that can be done, but a physical thing like a book or a filmâ€¦ MK: Everyone knows how much I obsess about The Exorcist. I spent decades taking that film apart to see how it works. I know how every single shot of that film was created. I can tell you the day on which every single shot was created. I can tell you who was in the room when it was created. And then you play it, and it just works. It doesnâ€™t make any difference. Will everything be all right in the end? Hannah Young, London MK: Yes. SM: OK, so this is from the line: â€œWill everything be all right in the end?â€<9d> followed by â€œYes, if itâ€™s not all right, itâ€™s not the end.â€<9d> That line turned up again recently, in The Split. We established on the show, after exhaustive research, it comes from Best Marigold, doesnâ€™t it, Mark? MK: It has many sources, but what we turned out to be quoting was Best Marigold, yes. SM: This taps right back into Jason Isaacâ€™s question about being an island of positivity. Because there is no doubt that when Mark said that line in the show for the first time, it really, really struck a chord with a lot of people. And when we mentioned it to Tom Hanks, Tom Hanks absolutely loved itâ€¦ Of course, when you take it out and analyse it as a statement, it doesnâ€™t really hold any water. MK: But as a mission statement, itâ€™s a good one. SM: Iâ€™ll go along with it as a mission statement.

On the pitch, in the stands, in households around the country and even in the BT Sport commentary box â€“ nobody except the referee, Craig Pawson, and his assistants seemed quite sure what exactly was going on. The big screen informed fans a possible offside was being checked and Eddie Nketiah was duly and correctly adjudged to have been guilty: no goal. Afterwards, another check was made on a potential foul on Saka by Alex Telles in the build-up to the disallowed effort. Pawson adjourned to his pitch-side monitor and perhaps under pressure from a crowd whipped into a frenzy by a furiously gesticulating Mikel Arteta, awarded Arsenal a penalty which was duly dispatched by Saka. Whether or not the penalty should have been given remains unclear and far from obvious, but the fact that so few paying punters at the Emirates Stadium knew exactly what was happening for the length of time it takes to boil an egg or run the kind of mile Sir Roger Bannister would be ashamed of seems more than a little strange. It was by no means the first time a paying crowd in a Premier League football stadium or those watching at home have been left shrouded in uncertainty during a VAR check and it almost certainly wonâ€™t be the last. However, it could be, if like in NFL, for example, the match officials tasked with making these big calls were able to explain to the folks watching in the ground and at home what it is exactly that is being checked and why. We have the technology; in the US, football referees have been using it to provide increased transparency and credibility to on-field rulings for just shy of 50 years. We have micâ€™d up referees before, albeit not for the reasons outlined above. Last week on Sky Sports, Inside The WSL was devoted to an interview with the extremely engaging head of refereeing in the Womenâ€™s Super League, Bibiana Steinhaus-Webb and featured a segment in which Emily Heaslipâ€™s every word could be heard by viewers as she officiated a topâ€‘flight match between Chelsea and Reading. While the crowd at Kingsmeadow could not hear the rationale behind Heaslipâ€™s decisions in a one-sided match that was unfortunately low on contentiousness, the experiment did provide a fascinating and educational insight into the reasoning behind the big calls she made both on her own and in collaboration with her assistants running the lines. â€œSo much information is shared within the team which are crucial for making the right decisions,â€<9d> said Steinhaus-Webb, a former Fifa-listed referee and the first woman to take charge of games in the Bundesliga. â€œThank you so much actually for doing that with us, to communicate to a wider audience and really let people know what is going on on the field of play.â€<9d> Of course at this point it behoves us to hark back to the first occasion an English referee was micâ€™d up as part of a similar wheeze, when David Elleray took on the role of guinea pig for ITVâ€™s World In Action during a match between Millwall and Arsenal at the Den in 1989. Legend has it that while both clubs were informed of the experiment, nobody at Highbury saw fit to tell Arsenalâ€™s players. The upshot? Millwallâ€™s players were uncharacteristically polite to the point of saintliness in their dealings with Harrowâ€™s most famous housemaster, while those of Arsenal effed and jeffed their way through the game with foul-mouthed abandon, with skipper Tony Adams at one point being heard to scream in no uncertain terms that Elleray was â€œa fuckinâ€™ cheatâ€<9d>. Far more recently, a clip of an A-League match refereed by a micâ€™d up Jarred Gillett earned the Australian match official no end of viewer plaudits for the calm efficiency with which he went about his business. It was his final game Down Under before his move to England, where he now referees in the Premier League and like all his colleagues, is routinely abused by fans who often have only a very vague understanding of many of the laws of the game and the thinking behind their enforcement. â€œThereâ€™s a bit more of an appreciation that we can quickly explain things, offer an interpretation to the players that most times theyâ€™ll accept if you can explain it in quick, simple terms,â€<9d> Gillett said of his experience of broadcasting to a TV audience. â€œI can see at some point in time that the comms, certainly between the referees and VARs, that some elements of the decision-making process will be broadcast.â€<9d> Now seems as good a time as any, almost three full seasons after the introduction of video assistant referees who regularly add to confusion surrounding the kind of decisions they were brought in to clear up. While there is no need for matchday crowds and TV viewers to hear every word spoken by referees during games, match officials might welcome the opportunity to keep them informed of what exactly is happening during lengthy pauses for VAR checks and provide concise, informative explanations of whatever decisions are ultimately made. While officials will still make mistakes, those affected by them would at least get to see that most if not all refereeing errors are ultimately made in good faith. Players, managers, pundits and fans have long called for referees to come before the cameras after games to explain their more perplexing decisions. The sport of football might be better served if we all got to hear them do so while those on-field judgments are being made.",FALSE,"pillar/sport","Sport"

But instead the world No 1 tennis champion â€“ and noted vaccine sceptic â€“ is cooling his heels in an Australian quarantine hotel, while an international row rages over whether he should be kicked out of the country altogether. Djokovic had boasted on social media of securing an exemption, for medical reasons he has not explained, to the rules that all players in the Australian Open must be double-jabbed. But hours later he was stopped at the airport, his visa cancelled, and he was unceremoniously threatened with deportation. His lawyers are challenging that ruling, meaning the outcome of this particular tournament may now be determined in a court â€“ rather than on one. Not since the actor Johnny Depp and his then wife, Amber Heard, flew their two dogs, Pistol and Boo, into the country by private jet without the necessary paperwork has the power of celebrity met the force of Australian biosecurity requirements with quite such explosive results. In fairness to Djokovic, this farce may not be entirely his fault. Someone somewhere, either in his camp or in Australian tennis, may have screwed up by allowing a situation to arise where the tournamentâ€™s biggest box office draw was seemingly given a free pass to compete in the country, but not actually to get there. Yet few tears will be shed for the man now inevitably known as â€œNovaxxâ€<9d> Djokovic. Around the world, patience with those who are wilfully unvaccinated is running out in the face of yet another viral surge. Just over a month ago, I wrote about how the mood might harden as intensive care beds filled with patients realising too late that they should have got the jab, while restrictions once again loomed over people who had done what was asked of them. Now that scenario is unfolding, with Franceâ€™s President Macron playing to the gallery by vowing to do everything he can to â€œpiss offâ€<9d> those who are unjabbed, while angry callers to British radio phone-ins demand anti-vaxxers be stripped of their right to NHS treatment if they get sick. Elsewhere in sport, the Premier League, facing a stubborn minority of unvaccinated top-flight footballers and fears of cancelled fixtures, has reportedly discussed making those who are unjabbed travel separately to games or eat their meals away from other players. Itâ€™s an uncomfortably divisive idea, stopping only just short of making them carry a bell and shout: â€œUnclean! Unclean!â€<9d> But what if the alternative is double-jabbed players growing increasingly resentful at having to sit matches out because theyâ€™re isolating, after contact with infected teammates? Balancing the incontrovertible human right to refuse a vaccine against the rights of others not to be held hostage by that decision is the single biggest challenge of this stage of the pandemic, and thatâ€™s what makes Djokovicâ€™s case resonate far beyond tennis. There is an undeniably ugly undercurrent to some of this hostility towards the unvaccinated, who are disproportionately likely to be poor, marginalised and from minority-ethnic backgrounds. Punishing people who often have deep-seated reasons not to trust the authorities for failing to get their jabs not only risks heaping discrimination upon discrimination, but represents a profound failure to understand why they didnâ€™t want to comply in the first place, which makes it impossible to convince them to change their minds. But thereâ€™s nothing obviously marginalised about a millionaire sportsman arrogantly demanding the right to jet into a country suffering record infection rates in hopes of lifting yet another lucrative trophy. Australians have endured restrictions so draconian that thousands of them stranded abroad at the start of the pandemic werenâ€™t even allowed back into their own country. Djokovic has less in common with an agonised British care worker, on minimum wage, facing the sack if they donâ€™t get the jab, than with a frequently more middle-class form of anti-vaxxer who slips under the radar. He is a believer in â€œnaturalâ€<9d> healing who once suggested that polluted water could be cleansed by the power of positive thinking, insisting that science had proved â€œthat molecules in the water react to our emotionsâ€<9d>. Heâ€™s entitled to hold whatever wacky beliefs he likes, of course, but he doesnâ€™t have a God-given right to escape the professional consequences of them, and still less does he have the right to impose consequences on others. The clout he wields as an international sportsman, meanwhile, makes it all the more important that he be seen to follow the rules. â€œOne rule for them, another for the rest of usâ€<9d> remains the single most toxic charge of the pandemic, whether levelled against Downing Street aides tucking into convivial Christmas wine and cheese at a time when ordinary mortals werenâ€™t even allowed to see their own parents, or against big-shot Hollywood names granted entry to Australia for film and TV work when most people were barely allowed to leave their own homes. It taps into a sense of grievance about elites getting away with things the little guy canâ€™t that is arguably never far from the surface of politics, visibly inflamed by a pandemic in which too many powerful people have been caught ducking the rules so painfully obeyed by others. No wonder Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister criticised for his own handling of the pandemic, leapt at the chance to declare that â€œrules are rulesâ€<9d> and apply to everyone. Unlike tennis, fighting a pandemic is a team effort. If he doesnâ€™t want to be booed off the next court he actually gets to play on, Djokovic would do well to remember that.

Gilliamâ€™s leading man, veteran French star Jean Rochefort, suffered a herniated disc midway through shooting and was unable to carry on, dealing a death blow to an under-funded, over-ambitious production already traumatised by biblical floods that swept away their equipment in the Spanish desert, Nato jets overhead which ruined the soundtrack, and insurers who wouldnâ€™t pay out on Rochefortâ€™s illness and became the obstructive legal owners of the script by Gilliam and Tony Grisoni. When I first saw this movie, I felt that there was a kind of perfect poignancy in Gilliamâ€™s Quixote never getting made and existing only in his head â€“ but Gilliam proved me and all other doubters wrong by finally getting it done in 2018 with Jonathan Pryce and Adam Driver in the leading roles. If it wasnâ€™t quite the masterpiece we hoped for, it was still an entertaining and affecting piece of work. In the years since the documentary was made, we have lost Rochefort; he died in 2017, having had a busy career after the Quixote debacle, but who probably owed his life to Quixoteâ€™s conscientious first AD, Phil Patterson, who was reluctant to force him to risk his health, and emerges as this documentaryâ€™s quiet hero. There is also veteran French producer RenÃ© Cleitman, who died in 2004: seen here delivering that remarkable speech to his glum crew about â€œthe fragility of the human being and the fragility of cinema itselfâ€<9d>. Gilliamâ€™s Sancho Panza Johnny Depp has seen his own reputation damaged these days but Gilliam himself, though skirmishing a bit in the culture wars, carries on. Itâ€™s a documentary that should be shown in all film schools. â€¢ Lost in La Mancha is released on 15 April in cinemas.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

Itâ€™s a fair description of someone who started playing guitar in bands aged 13, founded the Smiths at 19, departed the band five years later, and went on to become an integral part of the sound of the Pretenders, Electronic, Modest Mouse and the Cribs. Latterly, Marr has contributed to soundtracks with Hans Zimmer, including the Billie Eilish song No Time to Die for last yearâ€™s Bond film, and made four solo albums. His latest is Fever Dreams Pts 1-4, a terrific, vigorous double album of 16 tracks that swoops from moody introspection to rousing anthems. So, yes, after 40 years in the business, itâ€™s hard to deny Marrâ€™s zeal and commitment. â€œWhen you get older, you learn that no matter whether your work is in or out of fashion, itâ€™s all about whether you can stand behind it,â€<9d> he says, â€œbecause you canâ€™t do anything about the trends and fashions and the way you are perceived too much â€“ thatâ€™s a really secondary load of baggage that just gets in the way. So there are definitely some advantages to the mentality of being older: you donâ€™t really care too much about being liked, certainly not as much as how much you like the work.â€<9d> At 58, Marr is, you have to say, in indecently good nick: his eyes alert, his skin clear, his hair raven black. He hasnâ€™t always lived the most temperate life, but he became a vegetarian in the mid-1980s, and he hasnâ€™t had a drink or smoked for more than 20 years. Since he was a kid heâ€™s been a ball of energy, but these days his release is running, and he has completed marathons in under four hours. Marr met his wife, Angie, when they were both teenagers, and they have two grown-up children. He is careful not to preach, but perched on a stool in a photo studio in north London, sipping green tea, heâ€™s certainly an impressive advertisement for wholesome living. â€œItâ€™s worth saying that if I thought that drugs and booze would make me a more interesting musician I would do it,â€<9d> says Marr. â€œAnd I donâ€™t go around skipping through cornfields, by any means; I have my issues just like anybody else. But itâ€™d be tougher if I was a boozer, thatâ€™s for sure. I just donâ€™t think itâ€™s a particularly happening drug. I donâ€™t think Bob Marley thought that either.â€<9d> On the evidence of our shout-out for questions for this feature, there is clear affection for Marr, both from former collaborators and Observer readers. Not everyone, though, feels so well disposed. After our interview took place, his former Smiths bandmate Morrissey posted an â€œopen letterâ€<9d> on his website asking Marr to stop talking about him in the press. â€œMove on,â€<9d> the singer wrote. â€œItâ€™s as if you canâ€™t uncross your own legs without mentioning me. Our period together was many lifetimes ago, and a lot of blood has streamed under the bridge since then. There comes a time when you must take responsibility for your own actions and your own career, with which I wish you good health to enjoy. Just stop using my name as click-bait.â€<9d> Marr, on Twitter, responded that open letters havenâ€™t â€œreally been a thing since 1953â€<9d> and went on: â€œAlso, this fake news businessâ€¦ a bit 2021 yeah?â€<9d> And in fairness to him, Marr didnâ€™t say the name Morrissey once in our 90-minute conversation. A couple of readers asked emotional questions about the Smiths, but his responses were thoughtful and measured, as you can judge below. As for Morrisseyâ€™s complaint that Marr doesnâ€™t discuss his own solo work, Marr would probably much rather do that, but he knows that fans are still interested in the Smiths, and he seems to feel no compulsion to erase that period of his life. He would brush off the comparison, but Marr is almost entering Paul McCartney territory. Both men were blamed by many for the break-up of their iconic British bands; both have remained mostly tight-lipped about what went down and have relentlessly worked in the intervening decades to create new material that they know will inevitably be compared to their formative output. And both McCartney and Marr seem to be now enjoying a revisionist take on their lifetime in music. Has Marr seen Get Back, the Peter Jackson documentary series about the Beatles? â€œYeah, amazing,â€<9d> he replies. â€œThere were so many things to take from it, little things. And that 50 years later Paul McCartney is exonerated almost. Really, really impressive. He kept a lid on a lot of things for whatever reasons. I think thatâ€™s really impressive.â€<9d> Did any of that resonate with Marr? â€œMaybe, yeah,â€<9d> he says with a wry smile. â€œNo, I wouldnâ€™t want to say that. I think Paul McCartney is out on his own dealing with a whole lot of different agendas on a world scale, on a historic scale. But he definitely seems to be such an impressive person because of how heâ€™s just stayed human. Heâ€™s an absolute beacon for everyone. And, yeah, it does cross my mind quite often: if he can do it, anyone can, know what I mean?â€<9d> Questions for Johnny Marr from readers and famous fans Which song have you written that still gives you goosebumps? And which canâ€™t you stand any more? Richard Hornby, Manchester Iâ€™ve always really liked That Joke Isnâ€™t Funny Anymore by the Smiths. And Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me and The Headmaster Ritual. City of Bugs by the Cribs, Dashboard by Modest Mouse and Get the Message particularly by Electronic. I think itâ€™s one of the best things Iâ€™ve ever done; almost my favourite, really. What sounds donâ€™t I really like very much any more? I got tired of Heaven Knows Iâ€™m Miserable Now pretty quick. As much for the music as anything else. What else? I know Reel Around the Fountain is a big, big song for some people, but I fell out of love with that fairly quick. I donâ€™t want to ruin it for people but, yeah, those two songs I could live without. Debbie Harry, singer How has the global pandemic changed your sources of inspiration? Iâ€™ve just come out of this two-year period having made a double album. But to be honest, it was time for me to make a record anyway. I went into the pandemic with this idea for an album called Fever Dreams. Iâ€™d started a few songs already, but then broke off to do the James Bond movie. Then the pandemic started and I definitely didnâ€™t want to make a lockdown record and be singing about the stores not being open and anti-vaxxers or any of that. But the psychology of that time and how it was affecting me and my thinking, and how that might be the same for my audience, fed into the album entirely. Jason Williamson, lead vocalist of Sleaford Mods As someone who broke into music in their 40s, how do you navigate pushing forward in an industry that mostly values youth? Iâ€™m maybe being over-idealistic here, but I think that people or fans of music recognise an artistâ€™s agenda and possibly their motivation. You can tell a lifer when you see them. And Sleaford Mods are a really good example of that. In a way, the fact that you can be still bothered with all the bullshit involved in a modern career says quite a lot about you, I think. Itâ€™s as simple as that. What do you think about being considered a fashion icon, particularly among some groups of current teenagers? Daisy, 22, Liverpool Well, these days, you just cross your fingers and hope for the best. Me and my sister got into clothes really young, like eight or nine. Growing up on a housing estate, itâ€™s something to share and be in competition and get noticed and obsess about. And itâ€™s never really left me. But it all comes from an interest in style and design, I think, not vanity. So Iâ€™m glad some people are noticing. Because otherwise, Iâ€™ve wasted a lot of my time. Guy Garvey, musician I heard you were collecting art long before the Smiths took off â€“ is that true? Yeah, it is, but it was stuff from junk shops. The most valuable stuff was some Man Ray and David Bailey photographs that I picked up on an excursion to Covent Garden in this crappy little junk shop. But the first thing I got into when the Smiths took off was collecting books, buying first editions. People like Isherwood, Huxley, Bernard Shaw, Gurdjieff. It wasnâ€™t anything to do with an investment; I just figured if I was going to educate myself, I might as well be holding a really nice artefact. Hans Zimmer, composer Which painters have influenced your sound the most? I suppose itâ€™s obvious, or obvious to me: Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, David Hockney, Cy Twombly, Paul Klee. With David Hockney, itâ€™s a sense of being wide awake, his sense of inquiry and joy and curiosity. David Shrigley has got this sense of knowing about him, and heâ€™s funny. I also think Tracey Emin is really deserving of her reputation. In some ways the noise around her persona gets in the way of the actual work sometimes. Maybe I can relate to that! Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester Did the Smiths ever fall out over football or politics? We never discussed football so thatâ€™s that. And we never fell out over politics, but we probably would now. Morrisseyâ€™s recent political views have cast a shadow over the Smiths for me â€“ reaching back into the past and tainting something that was very important to me. Iâ€™m so disappointed in him. Has it impacted how you feel about the Smiths or are you able to separate the past from the present, the band from the man? I find it very difficult to do so. Johnny Spence, Northern Ireland It hasnâ€™t impacted how I feel about the Smiths. Thatâ€™s all I can say about that. Iâ€™m certainly able to separate the past from the present. I donâ€™t know whether you can separate the band from the man, but I can separate myself from the man and what I did, so when I do see how disappointed people are, it really does make me sad. But itâ€™s completely out of my control. And I can only really do what is in my control. So I play Smiths songs for reasons that I think are real. And over the years Iâ€™ve tried to take care of the catalogue and the releases as much as I was able to. As I would have done anyway. So, you know, I see it the way everybody else sees it. I donâ€™t have any answers. And I donâ€™t want to have any answers. Nabihah Iqbal, musician and writer Where do you go to think? I go to a room in my house for half an hour in the morning and half an hour at night and meditate. Iâ€™ve done that for 20 years. It still doesnâ€™t get any easier for anyone whoâ€™s thinking of taking it up, but it works, it does work. Most people use running to unwind, but for some reason, I just get more rewound and get a lot of ideas. I certainly donâ€™t zone out. But, yeah, either meditating or running. Bernard Butler, musician We have both had many casual musical flings but one very strong personal bond in our lives. How has your relationship with the wonderful Angie influenced your creativity, and does she have a favourite guitar? Iâ€™ll answer the easy bit first: Angieâ€™s always loved Les Pauls. Thatâ€™s to do with when we first met â€“ she was 14 and I was 15. We were into Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, so she became bit of a Gibson fan. Iâ€™ve had a Gold Top guitar for 20-odd years and I think if Iâ€™ve ever got rid of that one, sheâ€™d leave me. The important thing I can say about my relationship with Angie is that she made me brave at 15, 16. Not only did Angie know me before everybody else knew me, but she knew me before I knew myself. She was there before the Smiths started: it was me and Angie. And then when that whole thing got together, it was me and Angie and Joe Moss [the late manager of the Smiths]. Not only was I with my soulmate, but I was with somebody who was very smart and very talented. Lottie Pendlebury, singer and guitarist of Goat Girl I feel that listening to the Smiths growing up and hearing your guitar playing was crucial to my understanding of the guitar and how to approach it, as I can imagine it was for many others. Who were your main influences growing up and what kind of techniques did they provide you with? Wow. Well, first off, itâ€™s great to get a question from Lottie because sheâ€™s one of my favourite musicians to come out over the last few years. Whenever I hear a Goat Girl track and I donâ€™t know itâ€™s them, Iâ€™ll say to whoever Iâ€™m with: â€œI really like this, whoâ€™s this?â€<9d> And itâ€™s always Goat Girl; I should know by now. So Iâ€™m chuffed about that. The biggest influence on me would have to be Bert Jansch. When I was about 14, a friend of mine told me heâ€™d got into this folk group called Pentangle. And I immediately thought: â€œWell, OK, I donâ€™t need to know any more about that.â€<9d> Anyway, when I was round at his house, he played me Basket of Light by Pentangle. And I couldnâ€™t believe what I heard, especially from the guitar: it was jazzy, it was bluesy and kind of funky, it went off all over the place. I could see straight away that there are people who are influenced by Bert Jansch that donâ€™t even know it. Anyone who got into Nick Drake â€“ totally into Bert. Anyone who got into Led Zeppelinâ€™s acoustic stuff, Neil Young, Donovan, therefore the Beatles. No Bert Jansch, no Back to the Old House, no Unhappy Birthday, even my electric stuff. So it runs all the way through what I was doing in the Smiths. All roads lead back to Bert Jansch. Maxine Peake, actor You really are a musical chameleon â€“ would you ever consider becoming an actor? If so, what would be your preferred medium: film, TV or stage? I personally think you would be a natural. Do you know what, Maxine? Telly or film, Iâ€™m not fussy. Iâ€™d like to play a menacing, villainous eastern European gangster or a drug dealer. One or the other, as long as itâ€™s not a fucking musician from Manchester in the 80s. Thatâ€™s about the depth of my range. Or if Robert Downey Jr decides to retire Iâ€™ll just take his gig â€“ got the same haircut. Itâ€™s apparent that you keep getting better and better with age. Can you speak to the role that removing alcohol from your life has played in that? Mike Shennan, Ontario, Canada Giving up alcohol has played a massive part in the last 20-odd years of my life, from day one. Without getting judgy, because people get very touchy about this shit, I can really recommend it. Iâ€™m not coming from a place of abstinence or a place of â€œmy drink and drugs hellâ€<9d>, but for me, I just thought it was a shit drug, and other drugs were better. No, seriously, if anyone gave me a pill that would make me feel that shitty the next day and say such stupid things then I just wouldnâ€™t be taking it. Neil Tennant, musician Youâ€™ve played on orchestral film soundtracks â€“ do you ever listen to or take inspiration from classical guitar music? I donâ€™t, to be honest, no. Whenever Iâ€™ve been recommended classical music â€“ once or twice by Neil in fact â€“ Iâ€™ve enjoyed it. But itâ€™s just a little bit too formal for me. I like the guitar to do everything but formal. Iâ€™m aware that it can be dramatic and expressive, but whenever Iâ€™ve listened to Julian Bream or something like that, it has always felt just too stiff to me. I was at Glastonbury in 2019 when you played There Is a Light That Never Goes Out at the end of your set. Without wanting to sound too gushy and obsessive, men and women in their 40s and 50s were openly crying, I guess because it felt like you were giving us permission to love these songs again. What is going through your head when you perform these songs? Do you feel any sadness or regret, or do you feel that you are claiming them fresh, as yours? Lindsay Wright, London Iâ€™ve been asked about claiming the Smiths songs quite a lot before and Iâ€™m not doing that. Because Iâ€™m a musician, Iâ€™m thinking about joy and about giving people that I like something they love. I feel like their sort of leader, conducting everybody. Of course Iâ€™m aware that thereâ€™s a lot of different meanings going on for people, and I experience this huge wave of elation, thereâ€™s no doubt about it. After just a few seconds, Iâ€™m just joining along with everybody else really. Itâ€™s no deeper than that. But I donâ€™t think I need to claim anything, because I wrote them. Bobby Gillespie, musician When you left the Smiths you said youâ€™d like to be like Nils Lofgren. It was something I instantly understood, but could you explain to non-Nils fans what you meant? Never been asked that before; trust Bobby. My introduction to Nils Lofgren was in the 1970s and finding out that he was a young, hyperactive ace guitar player who had been brought in as a ringer for Neil Youngâ€™s Tonightâ€™s the Night. He was little, like me, and a great singer. Then in the 80s, he was playing with Bruce Springsteen. So I guess really what Bobby was understanding was this idea of the ringer. I always found that really attractive: John McGeoch did it when he went from Magazine to the Banshees to Public Image; Ronnie Wood did it when he went from the Faces to the Rolling Stones. Nile Rodgers has done it with countless groups. And I was relating to that, really, as a way for me out of this shitstorm that was the Smiths split. Youâ€™ve recently collaborated with one of todayâ€™s most popular artists, Billie Eilish, on the brilliant track No Time to Die, which won a Grammy. Are you planning on doing another collaboration like this? I would love to see you work with Taylor Swift, who you recently tweeted about playing your signature Jaguar guitar! Paula, Malaga, Spain Well, I canâ€™t think of one collaboration that Iâ€™ve done over 40 years that I went after. They all come about by being invited by always very interesting people. When me and my band were listening to Billieâ€™s first record on the tour bus, I had no idea that I was going to be doing the Bond song with her that would get to No 1. So itâ€™s quite likely that some other stuff is going to happen that I donâ€™t know about. That window is always open for me, for whoever it is. Pauline Black, singer My favourite track on your new album, Fever Dreams Pts 1-4, is Ariel. The music and the lyrics successfully mesh together with a convincing, almost dark intention. You have spoken about getting in touch with your â€œfeminine sideâ€<9d> on this album. Sylvia Plath, who wrote the astonishing collection of poems Ariel, and who youâ€™ve said in interviews influenced this song, very much turned upside down the notion of â€œfeminineâ€<9d> as it was understood in 1965. So I am interested to know how you embrace your â€œfeminine sideâ€<9d> in this new age of gender politics in 2022? Well, I was brought up with a sister whoâ€™s 11 months younger than me. And we are incredibly close. And Iâ€™ve been with my wife since I was 15. And Iâ€™ve got a daughter whoâ€™s now 27. As well as that, Iâ€™ve worked with some really amazing women like Chrissie Hynde and Kirsty MacColl. So itâ€™s never really been too difficult to have an awareness of the life that the women around me might be living. I think there are a lot of men out in the world right now who are really enjoying the opportunity to be part of a change. Itâ€™s an exciting time of, hopefully, enlightenment. Now Iâ€™m aware that plenty of people might scoff at that and think Iâ€™m being naive, but speak for yourself! But Iâ€™m really glad Pauline clicked with Ariel, because if thatâ€™s coming across, thatâ€™s good, because itâ€™s there. Billy Bragg, singer-songwriter and activist You once told me that your unique guitar style was just â€œMartin Carthy licks sped upâ€<9d>. How influential was traditional folk music on your development as a musician? Well, to follow on from Lottieâ€™s question, because of that introduction to Bert, you then need to know about Davey Graham and Martin Carthy. This was just before punk, and compared with the heavy rock that my mates were getting into, the more radical folk stuff just sounded much more interesting and tougher and less straight to me. But â€œMartin Carthy sped upâ€<9d> is actually quite a good way of describing what I was doing, with the equipment of the Patti Smith Group. The idea of folk music played through punk gear was really modern, but â€“ I also should insert here â€“ with the chord changes of the girl groups. My technique was folk playing, but harmonically I was going for Phil Spector music, with gear that my peers were using. Which book has had the biggest impact on you and why? Sarah Corbyn, Essex Iâ€™d say The Outsider by Colin Wilson, because itâ€™s the ultimate explanation of a certain kind of mindset that Iâ€™ve had, that Iâ€™ve recognised in myself from being a kid and maybe even a predicament sometimes in my own thinking, my own life. Or The Bhagavad Gita, which Chrissie Hynde introduced me to, because you can read it and read it and read it, and then keep doing it for thousands of lifetimes. Chris Packham, naturalist Johnny, the world is in a big mess but me and some of my equally defiant mates are determined to make a last stand for life. We will probably end up on a muddy hill surrounded by those who just donâ€™t care. Facing such odds, will you be willing to provide the rallying song to stir our hearts in the time of ultimate darkness? No pressure there then! I think even if I was to be ambitious enough to try and tackle a song on a big level, if it happened, it would be by accident. The last song on the new album, Human, is the closest Iâ€™ve got to writing something like that. Itâ€™s the most stirring song Iâ€™ve written myself on my own. But now I think of it, Iâ€™d either do it by accident or, yeah, Iâ€™ll try and accept the challenge! Harry Hill, comedian Johnny, out of 10 what would you give me for my turn as Mozzer on Celebrity Stars in Their Eyes? [Hill sang This Charming Man.] PS: if you and the fellas ever decide to regroup and his nibs wonâ€™t play ball, I still have the wig â€“ and more importantly, the hearing aid. I sort of remember that. Iâ€™m going to have to give Harry a solid two out of 10 for that, and he can make of that what he will. As for the offer, I donâ€™t even know what to make of thatâ€¦! What are you most looking forward to in 2022? Gemma Faulkner, London Well, the obvious thing is playing concerts. Human contact. Iâ€™m very fortunate that in my life I have strangers say hello to me on the street. And plenty of them just say â€œHiâ€<9d> and walk on â€“ they donâ€™t need to do selfies or anything like that. There was a time probably leading up to the pandemic that I was a little overwhelmed with selfies. And after a couple of years, Iâ€™m not saying: everybody come and take a selfie â€“ but Iâ€™m looking forward to human contact on a large scale.

Maddalena Casulana became the first female composer to publish her own music at a time when such creativity was far from encouraged in women. She believed that men were making a â€œfutile errorâ€<9d> in assuming that women could not compose as well as they could and she brought out three books of madrigals under her name between 1568 and 1583, although only one of those collections has survived complete. Now a further 17 madrigals have been added to her small surviving repertoire and 12 of those will be premiered on 8 March as part of BBC Radio 3â€™s special programming for International Womenâ€™s Day. In what is seen as one of the most important musicological discoveries of recent years, Laurie Stras, professor of music at the universities of Southampton and Huddersfield, has tracked down the lost alto partbook of Casulanaâ€™s 1583 book of five-voice madrigals, with such evocative titles as Breeze that Murmurs in the Woods. Vocal or instrumental polyphonic music was handwritten or printed in the 15th and 16th centuries in partbooks, with each part appearing separately. Stras said that Casulanaâ€™s madrigals could not have been performed without the missing parts: â€œIt would be like performing a string quintet without the second violin. It wouldnâ€™t have made sense. Iâ€™ve been able to complete it. The jigsaw puzzle has slotted into place.â€<9d> She tracked down missing parts from the printed edition to the Russian State Library in Moscow, piecing together the music through other fragments in the GdaÅ„sk Library of the Polish Academy of Sciences. It was from that Polish archive that the missing parts had disappeared in the second world war. They were presumably looted. They still bear GdaÅ„skâ€™s catalogue numbers. Stras said: â€œThe reason that these madrigals are really important is that Casulana was acknowledged by her male contemporaries as a wonderful composer. She would have had to have been. We talk about women today having to be twice as good as men. Thatâ€™s exactly what it was like then. These five-voice madrigals show us why she was such an extraordinary composer and why her contemporaries thought so highly of her. She is on the cutting-edge of composition in the 16th century. She uses really interesting harmonic effects. â€œWhat we will get from hearing these madrigals is a sense of whatâ€™s considered really top-quality composition in her lifetime. Sheâ€™s as good as any of the masters of her day. The closest comparison is Monteverdiâ€™s teacher, Marcâ€™Antonio Ingegneri, a composer of church music and madrigals.â€<9d> Casulana, who was also a lutenist and singer, was only too aware that, as a female composer, her music would be judged inferior to works created by her male counterparts. Her 1568 book of madrigals bears an extraordinary dedication to her illustrious patron, Isabella deâ€™ Medici Orsini, daughter of Cosimo I deâ€™ Medici and an amateur musician. She wrote: â€œThese first fruits of mine, flawed as they are â€¦ show the world the futile error of men, who believe themselves patrons of the high gifts of intellect, which according to them cannot also be held in the same way by women.â€<9d> But her male contemporaries recognised her talent. One called her the â€œmuse and siren of our ageâ€<9d>. Another described her music, performed at the wedding of Wilhelm V of Bavaria, as â€œmost beautifulâ€<9d>. Noting that little is known about Casulana, who is thought to have died in 1590, Stras said: â€œHow did she get to be so good? Where did she get that knowledge and that skill, because youâ€™re not just born with being able to write five-voice polyphony. Itâ€™s really hard.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

Over the next two years, in the early 2000s, he told the commission he was brutally beaten nearly every day. â€œI was a child at the mercy of a monster,â€<9d> he says. â€œBeyond physical abuse, he was cruel. How anyone could deem him safe to take care of me I donâ€™t understand.â€<9d> After one beating, Urlich says his caregiver swung open the door to his room where he lay bleeding and said: â€œOh yeah, your dadâ€™s dead by the wayâ€<9d>, then slammed the door closed. New Zealandâ€™s royal commission into abuse in state and faith-based care is the largest and most complex royal commission the country has held. The independent investigation put in motion in 2018, is tasked with revealing the extent of abuse within the institutions designed to protect children, and its ongoing effects. Over the past two weeks, the commission has held its first publichearings dedicated exclusively to MÄ<81>ori, giving survivors an opportunity to highlight the racism and cultural disconnection they also faced at the hands of the state. In total, 25 people â€“ a tiny fraction of the estimated 200,000 MÄ<81>ori survivors of abuse â€“ took to the stand to testify. In the 1970s, most children taken into state care were MÄ<81>ori, and over-representation of MaÌ„ori children in care has continued. According to the royal commissionâ€™s report, MaÌ„ori today make up 69% of children in care and 81% of the children abused in care, despite accounting for only about 16% of the population. The commission estimates about 655,000 people have been in care settings in New Zealand since the 1950s, and up to 256,000 may have been abused. Their testimony was livestreamed, and transcripts will be published on the commissionâ€™s website. Urlich says being MÄ<81>ori, and raised in a system that separated him from his culture and knowledge is â€œmodern day colonisationâ€<9d>. â€œThe only time I saw reference to Te Ao MÄ<81>ori [the MÄ<81>ori world] was outside of the education centre in a child, youth and family building â€“ there were koru patterns in the glass frostings of the meeting rooms,â€<9d> Urlich says. â€œI deserved more than that.â€<9d> Cultural separation â€˜profoundly abusiveâ€™ The trauma of being deliberately separated from whaÌ„nau, and MaÌ„ori culture arises time and again during the hearings. Some survivors say it â€œwas profoundly abusive in and of itselfâ€<9d>, says Julia Spelman (NgÄ<81>ti Hikairo), independent legal counsel assisting the commission. â€œAnd this challenges us to think about abuse in a broader way.â€<9d> â€œSome survivors described hating being MaÌ„ori, or of having their chance to be MaÌ„ori taken away from them; of having experiences so painful that they do not feel able to reconnect with their identity and what it means to be MaÌ„ori.â€<9d> The pain of that severance has intergenerational effects, some survivors say. A woman of Sami, Navajo, Aboriginal and MaÌ„ori descent was adopted by a PaÌ„keha [European] family as a newborn, after doctors told her then-16 year-old mother that her baby was sick and the best thing to do was leave her at the hospital for staff to look after. The doctors then falsely listed her ethnicity as European on her birth certificate, says the woman, who is acknowledged as Ms AF. â€œI think they did this because MaÌ„ori babies were less desirable for adoption.â€<9d> â€œThe moment my adoption happened was the minute I lost my legal Treaty rights as a MaÌ„ori. This is the one thing that broke my heart.â€<9d> Ms AF, who had been adopted into a religious household, was sent to a Catholic school, where she was physically abused. â€œThe nuns would use canes, their hands or whatever they could get their hands on to beat us.â€<9d> At age 18 when she fell pregnant, she was sent to a Catholic nunâ€™s home for unwed mothers where she was put under duress to adopt her son out. â€œI had no advice provided to me. The next thing I know my son had disappeared. I returned to New Plymouth that day. I didnâ€™t know that I could keep him.â€<9d> â€˜The beginning of my schooling on being a criminalâ€™ For others, the stateâ€™s intervention set them on the path of criminality. Hohepa Taiaroa, 62, of Tuwharetoa descent, had his first interactions with social services aged 10, while struggling with the separation of his parents, and his motherâ€™s new family. He started running away from home, and was sent to Kohitere boys training centre at 14 after he started stealing cars, and then Waikeria Borstal. â€œThat was the beginning of my schooling on being a criminal, and the start of learning how to fight,â€<9d> Taiaroa says. â€œInstead of learning MÄ<81>ori and other stuff we were supposed to learn, we learned how to steal, how to gamble, how to get ahead of everybody else in the system.â€<9d> Taiaroa says he was intimidated and assaulted at the institutions, and reprimanded for speaking MaÌ„ori. Because he was deemed â€œa runawayâ€<9d> he would frequently spend up to 23 hours in solitary confinement. â€œI never had a voice because my voice was these two things here, my fists. I couldnâ€™t even say a full sentence. It was just yes, no, and that was it. Thatâ€™s how much mamae [pain] and anger I had inside me.â€<9d> Taiaroa spent time in prison during his adult years, and had his own children taken by the state. â€œIâ€™ve lost three good families because of the violent way I was brought up in the system and the flow on effects on my whaÌ„nau.â€<9d> Towards the end of Urlichâ€™s testimony, he is asked by commissioners what the state should be doing now for MaÌ„ori children. â€œWe can stop viewing children in isolation of their family,â€<9d> he says. â€œIf the whaÌ„nau are not operating in a way that is safe or sustainable or nurturing for our tamariki [children] then do something about it, donâ€™t just take away the children because guess what, Crown, you donâ€™t have a nurturing, safe, loving environment yourselves.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Having lost the first two games of their campaign last year, Ireland opened with a resounding 29-7 win over the champions Wales in Dublin. â€œI would have snapped your hand off at the start of the game,â€<9d> said the Ireland captain. â€œBig time, against the reigning champions, to come away with five points. â€œWhen I looked out of the window this morning I knew it wasnâ€™t going to be pretty. Thankfully, the rain stayed away for the most part, but the wind played its part in both halves really. â€œWe knew if we could get a good foothold in the game in the first half playing into the elements, that second half weâ€™d have the breeze behind us and we could use it to our advantage.â€<9d> Last season, Ireland opened with defeat in Cardiff, a match that launched Walesâ€™s successful championship. A week later, they lost at home to France, where they travel next. â€œI canâ€™t tell you how demoralising the first game was last year,â€<9d> said Sexton. â€œThe triple crown was gone, the grand slam gone. Youâ€™re up against it to win the championship. Thatâ€™s what weâ€™re pleased about most. â€œWe feel thereâ€™s plenty of stuff to brush up on next week. France away is arguably one of the biggest tests in world rugby. We need to be at our very best and we need to learn some lessons from today, even in victory. We did that over November, and hopefully we can continue in that vein.â€<9d> After the low of that second defeat, Ireland ended up third in the table and embarked upon a winning run that now stands at nine and includes the scalps of England and New Zealand. â€œThereâ€™s always been confidence in the group, even when times were low in the first two games last year,â€<9d> said Sexton. â€œWe werenâ€™t too far away and thankfully weâ€™ve turned things around results-wise.â€<9d> For Wales, there were few positives. Josh Adams was shown yellow a few minutes into the second half, but Wales were 17-0 down at that point â€“ and another try down when he returned. Wayne Pivac was philosophical. â€œWe made 100-odd tackles in the first half,â€<9d> he said. â€œWhen you are defending for long periods like that, it makes it very difficult when we do get our hands on the ball. â€œIt is certainly a game we will go away and improve on very quickly.. We always look at performance; you can look at the result. After that many tackles, a bit of fatigue does set in. It happens to any side. â€œThe boys came back very strongly in that last quarter of the game and kept fighting towards the end, which is what we want.â€<9d> Wales were not awarded a penalty until the 54th minute. â€œThere was a lot of assistant referee interjection from one side of the field. He saw it a certain way and we might disagree with some of those calls, in particular the scrum. They see it the way they do and we have to go with those decisions at the time.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/sport","Sport"

Yes, in the newfangled world of reality TV, you can now find innovative formats where dates are disposed of via a trapdoor or contestants woo each other without speaking the same language. But 2020 and 2021 were packed with enough plot twists to last a lifetime. This is why the return of TV staple The Apprentice is so welcome. After two years off air, almost everything in the world has changed, bar the show itself. As always, Alan Sugar takes on a crop of business hopefuls who are confident to the point of delusion (which is how one of them actually described themselves in the first episode). Even the first few minutes of its return were characteristically thick with quotables: â€œI am the EST of everything, which means I am the coolEST, smartEST and wickedEST in businESTâ€<9d>, assured one contestant. Fascinatingly, the opening episode took place as though the past few years didnâ€™t happen. Bar the odd reference to the pandemic through Sugarâ€™s bad dad jokes (â€œYou donâ€™t get furloughed, you get fired!â€<9d>), you would be forgiven for thinking it had been shot pre-Covid. The economic uncertainty, the decimation of the high street and the remote-working revolution were things of neither the past nor the future. The strange time-machine energy was only exacerbated by the addition of the showâ€™s first winner, Tim Campbell, stepping in for Claude Littner, and a contestant introducing the word â€œboujiâ€<9d> to her entirely baffled team. Watching The Apprentice in 2022 is an exercise in nostalgia, a televisual DeLorean to transport us to the simpler time of 2019. It almost feels like the suspension of reality is intentional. Why else would the first task have been to launch a luxury cruise line, after possibly the most disastrous period for the industry in recent years? While the two teams built their rival brands, in the real world, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that every US passenger cruise had Covid cases on board. Meanwhile, the UK is still reeling from the disaster of the Britain-registered Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that was quarantined at Yokohama for a month in 2020 after almost a quarter of its 3,700 passengers were infected with Covid. But this is not a criticism. More often than not, TV is about the suspension of reality â€“ it is why sitcom characters referencing the pandemic can be so grating. If we wanted to watch the news, we would do so. The idea that the boysâ€™ team might encourage a post-pandemic boom in cruises with a logo that â€“ as pointed out by Twitter users â€“ resembled a Covid variant is surely a thing of fantasy. The girls gave them a run for their money in the ineptitude stakes, their cringe-inducing branding not much better than the boysâ€™ anthropomorphic oil spill. It is a demonstration of the showâ€™s commitment to representation; women can be just as belligerent and ridiculous as men, thank you very much. In these times, The Apprenticeâ€™s comeback should have felt irrelevant for an endless list of reasons, but the deja vu made it even more enjoyable than usual. At times, the show has appeared allergic to the future; Sugarâ€™s declaration in the opening episode that â€œTikTok is becoming very powerfulâ€<9d> sounded partly fearful. But this time the showâ€™s lack of innovation has worked in its favour. For nearly 20 years, we have been regaled by its familiar, formulaic combining of egos and schadenfreude â€“ and we probably will be for 20 more. If â€œkeep calm and carry onâ€<9d> were a TV format, it would be The Apprentice, the ultimate pair of reality-show safe hands.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

The New York City-based founders of the digital platform Health In Her Hue aim to bridge that gap. Since its launch in 2018, the platform has empowered Black women with the community and resources to find supportive, culturally sensitive care. Last summer, co-founders Ashlee Wisdom (chief executive) and Eddwina Bright (chief product officer) secured $1m in pre-seed funding, marking a turning point in their startupâ€™s success story. â€œFundraising is never a walk in the park, especially as Black women,â€<9d> says Wisdom. â€œNo matter how credentialed you are, itâ€™s hard for everyone. But then you add on the layer of the fact that there arenâ€™t many Black women who are building venture-backed companies or get funding. Weâ€™ve experienced some challenges throughout that journey.â€<9d> Now, the co-founders are in â€œbuild modeâ€<9d>. With their funding, the pair are working to develop a new web platform and membership experience, which will offer care support and resources tailored to each womanâ€™s specific healthcare needs. â€œUltimately, our vision for Health In Her Hue is to be the first touchpoint for women of color managing their healthcare,â€<9d> Wisdom says. Take us back to the beginning. What led you to launch Health In Her Hue, back in 2018? Ashlee Wisdom: At that time, two things were happening: I was working in a toxic work environment, and I was breaking out in chronic hives. So I was going to see an allergist, who happened to be a white woman. She was a great doctor, but because we didnâ€™t have that shared identity, it never occurred to me to tell her that I was dealing with racism and discrimination at work. So long story short, she was running all these tests on me and I wasnâ€™t allergic to anything. We couldnâ€™t figure out what was triggering the hives. After I left the job, I realized that they were related to that stressful, toxic work environment. That got my wheels turning, and made me realize that I shared much more with my Black gynecologist. If I was more transparent and felt more comfortable sharing the full picture of what was going on in my life, that allergist wouldâ€™ve been able to get to the root cause of what was triggering my hives. At the same time, I was getting my masterâ€™s in public health, and got really tired of reading research papers about the disparate healthcare outcomes for Black women. And so I decided I wanted to do something to support Black women and women of color to better manage their health and also better navigate the US healthcare system. Eddwina Bright: I think our first foray into working together was when Ashlee was doing a video series on maternal health and asked me to share my birthing story â€“ at that point, we knew each other socially. My experience giving birth to my oldest was not great. I felt very much coaxed into a C-section; doctors were not answering my questions, not telling my husband anything. It was just not a great experience. And so from that, I was able to take a step back and find a provider that was more culturally aligned with me. So when it came time to have my second child, I felt seen, I felt heard, I felt taken seriously, and was able to really advocate for myself and have a much better birthing experience. So thatâ€™s the passion that I bring to the work that we do. Iâ€™d like us to help the women that we serve to advocate for themselves without having to go through really traumatic healthcare experiences. And the company happens to align with my professional experience in finance and non-profit entrepreneurship. So we definitely have a great balance of health and business expertise. At what point did you realize that this business was making a real impact, and achieving what you hoped it would? Wisdom: From 2018 up until 2020, like right before the pandemic hit, we were building the community and seeing great feedback from women. But the resounding thing we kept hearing was that itâ€™s difficult to find a Black doctor, or a doctor of color, on existing platforms. So that was the impetus to build out a curated directory of Black physicians across the country. When we launched that directory in June 2020 â€“ given the pandemic and the racial reckoning â€“ people were ready. Thirty-four thousand people logged in within the first week or two. Bright: Separately, we also had articles and videos that people could engage with on our website, as well as a community forum where women could talk to each other. So we brought all of those components together to continue the momentum, and realized we had tens of thousands of women in our community. We only had six doctors at first, and now we have more than 1,000. What do you envision for the future of Health In Her Hue? Wisdom: We really want to continue to grow and expand the community so that Health In Her Hue is the go-to, safe space for women of color for all things healthcare-related. Thatâ€™s my overarching big vision for what weâ€™re building. Bright: I completely 100% agree. Iâ€™d love for us to also become a resource for Bipoc women to better navigate not only their individual health, but the health of their families: their kids, their spouse, their parents. Because we know that community health is very important for the collective. I would also like us to help support the talent pipeline of culturally sensitive health care providers. Maybe that means helping with scholarships and internships, putting students into doctorâ€™s offices and teaching them the business of medicine. Thatâ€™s a major gap in the market, which Iâ€™d love to see us fill.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

There have been very tough moments when I felt abandoned. I still feel abandoned. I received threats, I was intimidated and my whole life was compromised.â€<9d> After everything she has been through, Roseline (not her real name) is just thankful to be alive. At the start of October 2020, the young Haitian referee says she was threatened by the man she accused of sexually abusing her. It was two days after she had given evidence against Rosnick Grant, a former international referee who was vice-president of the Haitian Football Federation and president of its refereesâ€™ commission, to members of Fifaâ€™s â€œad hoc panelâ€<9d> investigating claims of sexual abuse. â€œThey assured me it was confidential but there was a leak somehow,â€<9d> Roseline says. â€œI received death threats.â€<9d> Fifa has denied any leak, claiming Roseline was targeted as a result of her name being in local media. Roseline called a member of Fifaâ€™s ad hoc panel for help but, by the time they responded 48 hours later, she had already been moved to a safe place. â€œIt was only because of your help that Iâ€™m still alive,â€<9d> she tells the Guardian. A few weeks earlier, Fifa was sent a letter from another female referee, this time in Zimbabwe. Muzwudzani (not her real name) claimed to have been subjected to repeated sexual harassment by Obert Zhoya, a senior member of the technical staff of the Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) and secretary general of Zifaâ€™s referees committee. Zhoya did not respond to the Guardianâ€™s request for comment. Muzwudzani also provided evidence of her allegations to world footballâ€™s governing body, to the Confederation of African Football (Caf) and to the Council of Southern Africa Football Associations. The case is now being investigated by police in Zimbabwe, having been referred to Caf by Fifa because it â€œdid not have the competence to investigate and judge such conductsâ€<9d>. Muzwudzani hasnâ€™t taken charge of a match since, while Zhoya remains in his position. â€œI had hoped that one day I would make it on to the Fifa panel,â€<9d> she says. â€œI could have played netball or soccer but I opted for officiating because I loved it. I looked at referees and I admired them. I used to think: â€˜One day I wish to be there. One day I wish to wear a kit that has those four letters â€“ Fifa â€“ written on it.â€™ But someone has taken that away from me.â€<9d> Muzwudzaniâ€™s story, published in January, is the latest example in a series of investigations of allegations of sexual abuse or harassment by the Guardian across world football. Itâ€™s a seam of stories that began in the UK with the former Crewe player Andy Woodward, a survivor, speaking about years of abuse by the coach Barry Bennell. Bennell was among 13 former youth coaches to have been sent to prison after the Guardian helped expose widespread abuse in British football that took place during the 1970s and 80s. But as well as high-profile cases in Afghanistan and in Haiti, where separate Guardian investigations led to the presidents of both FAs being banned for life by Fifa, other countries where the outcomes are unclear or not yet known have illustrated the inadequacies of the existing system. The Guardian has been alerted to allegations of more than 40 serious cases of sexual abuse or harassment in senior or international football in countries from all around the globe including Argentina, Australia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Gabon, Mongolia, Spain, the United States and Venezuela. Not all of them have been reported to Fifa. Some of the alleged victims are girls or young women; others are boys or young men. They are from countries where the accused are often part of the same power structure, making it even harder for them to report their abuse. And persuading Fifa to listen may be the start of a tortuous process for them and their families, with survivors in Afghanistan and Haiti having claimed that their concerns were disregarded or treated carelessly and their lives were even placed in danger. A Fifa spokesperson said all complaints are â€œhandled with the greatest of care and in the strictest of confidenceâ€<9d>. But a source who worked on both investigations says: â€œIn almost every case they have made procedural errors. We are just going around in circles â€“ nothing is actually changing.â€<9d> Afghanistan: â€˜Every day I see the justice that was needed but didnâ€™t comeâ€™ It has been nearly four years since Saima (not her real name) travelled to Jordan for a training camp with Afghanistanâ€™s womenâ€™s team. The trip was organised by Khalida Popal, a former head of the womenâ€™s football department at the Afghan Football Federation (AFF), who had been forced to flee the country in 2016 and seek asylum in Denmark. It would end up being unforgettable for all the wrong reasons. According to Popal, two male officials that had been sent by the AFF to accompany the squad repeatedly bullied and harassed her and other players. â€œIt continued,â€<9d> Popal told the Guardian in November 2018. â€œThese guys were calling on the rooms of the players and sleeping with the girls. AFF staff members would say to girls that they could get them on the team list and would pay them Â£100 a month if they would say yes to everything. They were pushing and forcing the girls. Coercing them.â€<9d> A few weeks later, Saima and eight other players were suddenly dropped from the national team and accused of being lesbians. The AFF president, Keramuudin Karim, who had assured Popal that he would take â€œserious actionâ€<9d> over the harassment claims in Jordan, was alleged to have beaten one of the players with a snooker cue after reports that she was considering telling her story to the media. Popal began her own investigation and said she discovered that Karim, a former governor of Panjshir province and chief of staff in the defence ministry before he took over the presidency of the AFF in 2004, had been accused of multiple counts of sexual and physical abuse. She said he even had a room inside his office containing a bed. â€œThe doors of his office [use] fingerprint recognition, so when players go in they canâ€™t get out without the fingerprint of the president,â€<9d> she claimed. Popal and the teamâ€™s head coach from 2016 to 2020, Kelly Lindsey, a former US international, said they attempted to report their findings to the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) but hit a brick wall. â€œThey basically said: â€˜We canâ€™t speak to you about this because youâ€™re not a member association, we need your president or your general secretary to speak with us,â€™â€<9d> recalls Lindsey. Fifa seemed to take more interest at first. Having recorded testimonies from several players, including interviewing Saima and her teammate Farzana (not her real name) over the previous six months, footballâ€™s governing body confirmed in November 2018 that it was examining allegations of widespread sexual abuse in Afghanistan, including several claims made against the AFF president. One alleged victim told the Guardian that Karim had put a gun to her head after he punched her in the face and sexually assaulted her, before threatening to shoot her and her family if she spoke to the media. â€œWhen we came forward and told our stories, of course Karim found out it was us, even though a good job was done to keep our identities out of the press,â€<9d> Farzana says. â€œLife became quite dangerous for us. Every day there were threats, we were continuously receiving phone calls from the federation, from Karimâ€™s people, offering money and things, they were trying to buy us. That was scary and dangerous.â€<9d> Despite evidence provided by several alleged victims, however, the investigation dragged on. â€œIn our eyes we were doing Fifa a favour, we were bringing these allegations to life so it could solve them, so it could be the good guy,â€<9d> Lindsey says. â€œAfter seven or eight months of conversation after conversation without any official process or system really seeming to be in place, it felt like we were going nowhere. We gave Fifa enough time to take action but it didnâ€™t.â€<9d> A Fifa spokesperson said that it had responded to allegations of sexual abuse in Afghanistan in early 2018. â€œOnce these reports were received, Fifa immediately began to investigate these serious allegations in a way that would ensure, first and foremost, the safety and security of the victims and survivors,â€<9d> he said. Two days before Karim was banned for life from all football-related activity and fined 1 million Swiss francs in June 2019 after a Fifa investigation found him guilty of sexually abusing â€œvarious female playersâ€<9d>, the Guardian revealed that Fifa had been made aware of sexual abuse allegations against Karim more than two years earlier. A formal complaint alleging abuse of players from the Afghanistan womenâ€™s team was sent in April 2017 by 34 of the provincial football presidents in Afghanistan to senior officials of Fifa, the AFC, including its official integrity-reporting email account; and the Afghan federation. A Fifa spokesperson said: â€œAlleged representatives of the Afghan provincial associations sent emails to various staff in Fifa in 2017, which made various claims and allegations about candidates and the AFF elections that were due to be held at that time. The various claims and allegations made to Fifa at the time were difficult to verify for two reasons: 1. the attachments/enclosures mentioned in the emails were never provided and 2. Fifa staff could not travel to Afghanistan for a fact-finding mission due to the serious security constraints within the country.â€<9d> For Popal, however, that explanation does not suffice and the failure to investigate the claims in 2017 meant Karim was allowed â€œto continue abusing and destroying the lives of innocent footballers. The fact that, after reporting the abuses, Fifa took so long shows how much they care about footballers and their lives. Every time I look into the eyes of those young girls I see the justice that was needed but didnâ€™t come.â€<9d> Popal and Lindsey aided both Saima and Farzana in leaving the country, helping to source visas for them to fly to India before they were moved to Switzerland. Saima and Farzana say it was only once they were on Fifaâ€™s doorstep that it properly took over, paying for their hotels so they wouldnâ€™t have to go into refugee camps until they were eventually housed by the government. â€œFifa didnâ€™t support us in the beginning, they didnâ€™t take any responsibility the way they should have done,â€<9d> Saima says. â€œKhalida and Kelly were doing their best to get us to a second country and save our lives. Fifa covered the costs of hotel accommodation and then we moved to the apartment, the government took over the responsibility.â€<9d> Fifa also helped Saimaâ€™s and Farzanaâ€™s families move to Pakistan as they were at risk in Afghanistan. Both women hoped they would also be able to join them in Switzerland and claim that they were given assurances they would reunited after six months â€“ something that has been denied by Fifa. It is understood that they signed a contract which made no guarantees about their families being relocated given that it was reliant on the visa process, over which Fifa had no influence. â€œFifa has and continues to offer support and assistance to ensure the safety of survivors, as well as to witnesses who choose to come forward and give testimony in Fifa ethics harassment and abuse cases,â€<9d> said the spokesperson. â€œSuch support includes, but is not limited to, working with local experts to provide psychological counselling, medical care and support, safe refuge, legal assistance, as well as providing for safe refuge support where possible to immediate family members that may also be at risk.â€<9d> Saima and Farzana are now unsure whether their families should remain in Pakistan or return to Afghanistan, where the Taliban took control last year. â€œOur families are suffering because of us, they are displaced and now the danger is greater than before as our enemies have got all the power they need from the changes in the country,â€<9d> Farzana says. Haiti: â€˜I lost my dreams, my hopesâ€™ At the end of February 2020, Yves Jean-Bart received a phone call. It was only a few weeks since the former journalist known as â€œDadouâ€<9d> had been elected as president of the Haitian Football Federation (FHF) for the sixth time, with Gianni Infantino congratulating him by sending a letter that had been hand-signed â€œCher Yvesâ€<9d> by the Fifa president. But on the other end of the line was a member of staff from the office of VÃ©ron Mosengo-Omba, who was then working as Fifaâ€™s chief member associations officer. As well as discussing how Haiti would respond to the impending Covid pandemic, the Fifa official also wanted to â€œraise concernsâ€<9d> about alleged sexual abuse cases in the countryâ€™s national football centre, the Centre Technique National in Croix-des-Bouquets, after it had received an inquiry from the Guardian a few weeks earlier. The victims felt that Dadou had been given a tip-off. â€œThey betrayed the victims to Dadou,â€<9d> says one source who has worked extensively on the case. â€œAfter that, they could never really trust Fifa.â€<9d> Fifa suspended Jean-Bart for six weeks after the Guardianâ€™s first article in April. He was eventually banned for life by Fifa in December 2020 after being found guilty by Fifaâ€™s ethics committee of having abused his position and sexually harassed and abused female players, including minors. The 74-year-old has consistently denied the claims and a June date has been set for his appeal hearing at the court of arbitration for sport. By the time Jean-Bart was banned as part of the Guardianâ€™s investigation, Roseline and several other young female referees had already detailed the abuse they allegedly suffered at the hands of Grant. â€œI spent several years as a referee and it was a constant fight,â€<9d> said one who did not want to be named. â€œWhen I was 17 years old, Grant tried to take my virginity. In exchange, he promised me so many things â€¦ Thatâ€™s how they do it. They helped some girls in a way that they canâ€™t speak out.â€<9d> Roseline hoped that agreeing to give evidence to Fifa would not only ensure protection for her and her family but result in swift justice against her alleged abuser. She was mistaken. Grant was contacted at the end of August 2020 by Fifaâ€™s ethics committee and asked to provide a written statement as part of their investigation, although he wasnâ€™t provisionally suspended until January 2021. Five months later and still with no news, Roseline wrote to several senior Fifa officials including Mario Gallavotti, an Italian lawyer who was then its director of independent committees and responsible for Fifaâ€™s independent ethics committee that investigates allegations of sexual abuse and other crimes by football officials. â€œI hereby inform Fifa of my serious concerns following a series of suspicious events relating to these testimonies,â€<9d> she wrote. â€œTwo days after my conversation with the members of the ad hoc panel, I received a call from Rosnick Grant, the person I had just testified against. During his call, Mr Grant intimidated me by clearly letting me know that he was aware of my testimony, although confidential, that I had just given. Mr Grant also told me he was untouchable. What especially frightened me the most was to learn, several months later, that my testimony was lost and was not found until February 2021.â€<9d> An email from a senior member of the ethics committee on 10 February 2021 that has been seen by the Guardian confirms that it had now â€œfound the declaration made on 6 October 2020â€<9d> by Roseline and â€œwhere possible, we would also like to have an interview with herâ€<9d>. A Fifa spokesperson said: â€œAny reports that are submitted confidentially or received, including personal testimony, are usually acted upon or revisited at various stages of an investigation.â€<9d> Roselineâ€™s letter in May 2021 also raised serious concerns about an article that had been published that week on the internet with the headline, â€œWho are Dadouâ€™s false witnesses?â€<9d> which threatened to reveal her identity and where she was staying. â€œI have no connection in this locality which was chosen by mutual agreement for my protection,â€<9d> she wrote. â€œAnd here we are in great danger now. Please do something. I am very afraid for my life and that of my family which are in your hands for the second time. Since last week, Rosnick Grant has kept calling me either to intimidate me or to ask me questions about my current situation. Thank you for your attention.â€<9d> To her surprise, Gallavotti responded by WhatsApp: â€œWe received your email, but I donâ€™t understand why. No one has â€˜lostâ€™ your testimony, we are hiding it to protect you; no one told anyone about your testimony which was kept confidential. Your name was already in the media before you testified and thatâ€™s why you were bullied by Mr Rosnick. If we want to improve football in Haiti and help young Haitians in sport, everyone must work in the same direction. If you need support, it is better to contact the competetant [sic] department directly and not to 15 people, most of whom are not aware of a confidential file.â€<9d> Asked whether this was a suitable response to an alleged victim of sexual abuse, a Fifa spokesperson said: â€œMr Gallavotti has confirmed that it was recommended to the alleged victim that they should contact the relevant body investigating at the time in order to receive further support.â€<9d> After originally being suspended in January, Grant was finally banned for life on 23 July 2021 having been found guilty by Fifaâ€™s ethics committee of committing acts of sexual harassment and abuse, as well as coercing young referees â€œto prevent the reporting of such sexual abuseâ€<9d>. The previous month, he had been accused of trying to arrange the killing of a radio journalist who had been attempting to uncover alleged corruption at the FHF. Grant has denied the claims. Asked why the process of banning Grant took almost nine months after his original suspension, the Fifa spokesperson said: â€œFor the investigative team in Haiti, the top priority has always been â€“ and remains â€“ the protection of victims, and they had for instance to intervene to provide support and protection to individuals that had been threatened. The proceeding was not slow, taking especially into account the travel restrictions due to Covid-19, several communication issues with the country, the hostility of the environment and above all the challenges in gathering evidence from victims and witnesses whilst ensuring their safety and care.â€<9d> An investigation into allegations that the former FHF technical director Wilner Etienne raped several female players under the age of 18 remains open more than 15 months after he was suspended. A Fifa source said it has â€œno evidenceâ€<9d> despite the testimonies of several alleged victims and witnesses. Etienne, who has denied wrongdoing and says the claims are a â€œpure lieâ€<9d>, was pictured at a charity match in November where he handed out medals. â€œWe can confirm that all evidence and testimony received by the investigatory chamber of the independent Fifa ethics committee was handled with the greatest of care and in the strictest of confidence,â€<9d> said the Fifa spokesperson. But Roseline believes they have not gone far enough. â€œI hoped Fifa will clean our mess because we donâ€™t have justice there,â€<9d> she says. â€œThe worst thing is that I love football so much. Sometimes I believe itâ€™s better I turn away from it. I lost my dreams, my hopes.â€<9d> Will the victims be heard? In the same month that Roseline and Muzwudzani had made contact with world footballâ€™s governing body to report their cases, Infantino appeared to be tackling the issue of sexual abuse head on. â€œIt is a topic we have been hiding for too long and it is time to start opening it,â€<9d> announced the Fifa president in September 2020. A new partnership with the United Nations office on drugs and crime included a pledge by Infantino to establish â€œan independent, multisports, multi-agency international entityâ€<9d> to investigate abuse cases. â€œWhat I am proposing is to study together the creation of an independent agency, some sort of a mix between sports bodies, institutional, governmental, international organisations, who can help our children who want to play sport to be and to move in a safe environment,â€<9d> he said. A year-long consultation process described by a Fifa source as â€œone of the most robust thereâ€™s ever been in sportâ€<9d> resulted in the final report being sent to stakeholders at the end of November 2021. It refers to â€œthe challenging learnings of complex, devastating and serious sexual abuses in Afghanistan and Haitian footballâ€<9d>. Gallavotti, who previously worked for Infantino during his time at Uefa, stepped down as director of independent committees in June 2021 to be replaced by Carlos Schneider. The safe sport entityâ€™s final report praises his â€œlegal wisdom and practical adviceâ€<9d> in â€œdefining an entity that may function for the benefit of all sports and help sports judicial bodies appropriately address harassment and abuseâ€<9d>. â€œThe idea is the formation of a foundation that will be endowed with independent governance,â€<9d> said Gallavotti on the Italian podcast No Coach: storie di abusi nello sport (stories of abuse in sport). â€œYou donâ€™t have to put the dust under the carpet. We need to talk about it.â€<9d> The evidence of the past four years, however, is that in many cases Fifa has appeared reluctant to do so. In Mongolia, the youth coach Uchralsaikhan Buuveibaatar was accused of physically and sexually abusing young players from the girlsâ€™ under-15 team in August 2019, although it is understood he continued to work for the Mongolian Football Federation until the end of November. The MFFâ€™s disciplinary body, which reported the matter three months later to the Asian Football Confederation, said that Buuveibaatar, who has denied committing â€œsexual crimesâ€<9d>, was first suspended from all football-related activities in August 2019. The AFC told the Guardian that Buuveibaatarâ€™s â€œsanction was extended worldwide by Fifa in August 2021â€<9d>. Fifa did not publicly announce the ban at the time. That case was not the first to raise concerns at the international playersâ€™ union, Fifpro. It is understood that there have been serious doubts over the effectiveness of Fifaâ€™s investigation into widespread sexual abuse allegations in Gabon that were reported by the Guardian at the end of 2021. The ethics committee confirmed on 10 January that it had opened a case, nearly a month after the first story alleging the former coach of Gabonâ€™s under-17s had been accused of raping, grooming and exploiting young players was published. Patrick Assoumou Eyi, known as â€œCapelloâ€<9d>, and two other youth coaches are facing up to 30 years in prison each if found guilty of charges including raping minors, sexual assault and endangering the life of another, with the Gabonese government having launched an investigation into widespread sexual abuse in the country as a result. Meanwhile, Serge Mombo, a leading football official who also served as Gabonâ€™s kitman at the Africa Cup of Nations, was arrested last month after being accused of sexually abusing young players and demanding sex as a condition of them securing places in national teams. Both have denied the abuse claims, made by alleged victims and witnesses to the Guardian. Fifpro has written to Fifa regarding its concerns that the investigation, which is being handled by the Gabonese Football Association (Fegafoot), has a conflict of interest. â€œAt least two of those arrested were employed by Fegafoot and closely connected to powerful people in Gabonese football,â€<9d> Fifpro told BBC Sport Africa. â€œFegafoot is not fit for purpose to investigate such serious allegations.â€<9d> A Fifa spokesperson said: â€œFifa can confirm that the matter is being handled in line with Fifaâ€™s code of ethics. Furthermore, Fifa is in contact with Fegafoot as well as Fifpro, on the matter. Since the matter is ongoing, including criminal charges having been made in Gabon, please understand that no further comment can be made by Fifa at this stage.â€<9d> Meanwhile the Gabonese playersâ€™ union has said that entrusting the federation with the investigation â€œwhen Fegafoot is at the centre of this affair in view of the revelations and its complicit silence proves that Fifa has not cared about all the victims of this abuse for all these decadesâ€<9d>. Fegafootâ€™s spokesperson, Pablo Moussodji Ngoma, told the BBC that Fegafoot itself â€œis also a victimâ€<9d> and said that its ethics committee would conduct an independent investigation. Lindsey tells the Guardian: â€œEvery single case Iâ€™ve heard has been almost identical, but when you try and structure the system from the top down it doesnâ€™t work.â€<9d> Concerns have also been raised about the restrictions in Fifaâ€™s own guidelines that state cases cannot be prosecuted more than 10 years after they occurred â€“ a regulation that is believed to now be under review. Neither Saima nor Farzana were part of the consultation process for the safe sport entity, which could be established in the next few months after the first meeting of its secretariat is understood to have been held last month. A Fifa spokesperson said it had â€œfollowed best practice throughout in consulting with voices of experience to ensure their meaningful involvement and to minimise retraumatisationâ€<9d>. But Saima insists that they should have been consulted. â€œTheyâ€™ve not asked our opinions,â€<9d> she says. â€œThe way that they dealt with our case was not professional â€“ and they didnâ€™t listen to our voices.â€<9d> Additional reporting by Alex Cizmic",FALSE,"pillar/sport","Sport"

They suspect their mother is dying and that they have limited time left with her. They have watched her slowly deteriorating over the past few weeks â€“ eating less, sleeping more, and talking to the invisible people she sometimes sees at the end of the bed. The tumour that has been growing in her breast has broken through the skin, and the odour is stifling. She has said many times in the past year that she is ready to die, and does not want to go to hospital. The familyâ€™s anxiety is rising as their motherâ€™s pain worsens and her delirium increases. During the day she gets extra tablets to help control her pain and she sleeps comfortably. The nights are the worst â€“ long hours of darkness, punctuated by her moans and rapid breathing. Tonight for the first time she is unable to swallow and canâ€™t take her regular medicines, including her opioid tablet. Before she finishes her shift, the registered nurse assures them that the doctor has been contacted and that an urgent referral has been sent to the palliative care team who will visit the next day. In the small hours of the morning, they notice her groans are becoming louder. They press the call bell repeatedly, frustration and concern growing by the minute. The wait for someone to appear is interminable, but finally a carer arrives. They ask if something can be given for the pain. The carer rearranges the pillows, straightens the blanket, and mumbles something about needing to make a phone call. She disappears, shutting the door behind her. As the sun rises, a registered nurse enters the room with an injection, but by then it is too late. The family sob quietly, tears rolling down their cheeks, struggling to come to terms with the fact their mother has just died and she will never hold their hands again. They have watched her suffer for hours. Their memory of those last moments with the woman that gave birth to them and raised them will be of her moaning in pain and struggling to breathe. Their grief will be complicated by anger, and by guilt. Why did they place her in a home? Why didnâ€™t they ask for her to go to hospital? They feel as if they have failed her. It didnâ€™t need to be this way. As a palliative care nurse practitioner I have looked after thousands of people who have died in residential aged care. I wish I could say that all of them had peaceful, dignified deaths, but I canâ€™t. Iâ€™ve seen and heard things you could never imagine. Things that keep me awake at night, dreading the day my family might have to find a place for me in residential aged care. Every day working in palliative care is incredibly challenging, none more so than when a facility doesnâ€™t roster registered nurses on site overnight. This adds a whole new dimension to trying to make decisions about prescribing and planning for a safe and comfortable death. Itâ€™s difficult when you cannot give families reassurance that their loved one will have symptoms controlled, especially when you know that is it is almost certain they wonâ€™t be able to receive the medicines they need during the night. Continuous infusions with opioids help, but regular repositioning and personal care can cause an escalation in pain, resulting in agitation and distress. Good palliative care anticipates this and recommends â€œas neededâ€<9d> doses be given before care â€“ but how can this happen if there is no nurse to give them? Older Australians living in aged care facilities are sicker than many people in hospital. They have complex clinical needs requiring skilled assessment and nursing care. A registered nurse on duty overnight in this familyâ€™s situation would have been able to give medicines to relieve pain and suffering. A registered nurse would have recognised that this womanâ€™s death was imminent, and administered the medicines as often as needed to make those last hours as comfortable as possible. Instead, a carer who had probably only received six weeks of basic training in personal care was the only person available overnight â€“ what a recipe for disaster. Under standard seven of the aged care accreditation standards, aged care facilities are expected to have a workforce that is sufficient, skilled and qualified to provide safe, respectful and quality care services. Yet right now there are no staff ratios, and no mandate to always have a registered nurse on site. The royal commission into aged care quality and safety heard evidence from countless people who relayed the suffering of their loved ones in residential aged care. Time and again, the issue of staffing skills and ratios was raised. The final report recommended that from July 2024 at least one registered nurse be always on site in residential aged care facilities. So far, the federal government has said it accepts the recommendations, but has failed to commit to implementing them. For nearly a decade they have failed to plan, and they have failed to act. In doing so, they have failed older Australians, and every single one of us who may eventually need 24/7 nursing care. As a society we must value and respect elderly people and guarantee they have equitable access to the clinical and personal care they need, no matter where they live. We need to ensure that resources such as registered nurses around the clock are mandated and funded across the aged care sector. Not in July 2024. Now. We cannot afford to delay. Peopleâ€™s lives, and their deaths, depend on it. Itâ€™s a huge task, and it will cost money, but we need to start somewhere.

Maxwell asked her if she wanted to become a massage therapist. Giuffre had been trying to get her life back on track, and this job was a key part of that plan. She has recounted how she had been sexually abused as a child, found herself moving in and out of foster care homes, and at 14 had been living on the streets suffering yet more abuse. She has recalled how she initially thought Maxwell and her close friend, Jeffrey Epstein, were â€œnice peopleâ€<9d> looking to help her earn some extra money. She had opened up to them about her past. â€œThat was the worst thing I could have told them because now they knew how vulnerable I was,â€<9d> Giuffre told the BBC in 2019. Soon, Giuffre says, she was being sexually abused by Epstein, and alleges she was â€œpassed around like a platter of fruitâ€<9d> among his high-profile friends, including Prince Andrew. Now, after years of fighting to be heard, Giuffre is at the centre of one of the worldâ€™s most-watched legal battles, alleging that Andrew sexually abused her when she was 17. This week, a New York judge refused to throw out Giuffreâ€™s civil case against the prince. The ruling could see Andrew, who strenuously denies the allegations, divulging aspects of his personal life in open court this autumn. While it may be possible for the duke to reach an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre, possibly costing him millions, there are suggestions she wants her day in court. Giuffre, who has become a prominent advocate for survivors of sexual misconduct, has said she wants her allegations against the Duke of York and other high-profile men in Epsteinâ€™s orbit to be heard. â€œIt wasnâ€™t just Jeffrey and Ghislaine who participated in this,â€<9d> Giuffre claimed in an interview with New York magazine earlier this week, speaking from her home in Perth, Australia, where she is raising a family of three children with her husband Robert. â€œJustice to me looks like holding all of these people involved in the sex ring, those who greased its wheels, named and shamed.â€<9d> Giuffre added that she was â€œsick of carrying around that shame. That shame doesnâ€™t belong to me.â€<9d> Giuffre has said she was somewhat relieved when 60-year-old Maxwell, daughter of late media mogul Robert Maxwell, was convicted of sex trafficking charges in December. â€œItâ€™s a bittersweet emotion because I have been fighting for so long,â€<9d> she told New York magazine. â€œIt doesnâ€™t stop with Maxwell. But itâ€™s definitely a relief to know that sheâ€™s off the streets.â€<9d> Epstein, a once wealthy and powerful financier, killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. The next stage in Giuffreâ€™s civil lawsuit against Andrew and other men, including Epsteinâ€™s lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who is accused of having sex with Giuffre when she was a teenager, may be discovery. Dershowitz denies the allegations. Andrew would be asked to provide information ahead of a possible deposition at which he is likely to be questioned about Giuffre and his associations with Epstein and Maxwell. The focus on his personal life could prove embarrassing for the prince. â€œLawyers file cases because they know the other side will not want to answer questions and will pay a lot of money to avoid doing that,â€<9d> says former sex crimes prosecutor Wendy Murphy. Murphy says she believes Andrew â€œwill try to delay it for years, or heâ€™ll offer a very large amount of money â€“ far more than the case is worth â€“ because heâ€™ll want to prevent himself from answering any questions.â€<9d> This weekâ€™s decision comes 21 years after Giuffreâ€™s alleged encounter with Andrew at Tramp nightclub, in which she recalls the duke sweating profusely on the dancefloor. In an interview with Newsnight in 2019, Andrew memorably countered this claim, saying he is unable to sweat. Giuffre alleges she was sexually abused by Andrew later that night in Maxwellâ€™s London townhouse. The prince denies the allegations, saying he was at home after a childrenâ€™s party at Pizza Express in Woking. Giuffre, then Virginia Roberts, spent four years as Epsteinâ€™s personal masseuse, during which she alleges she was trafficked to the financierâ€™s friends and clients. In a 2009 civil lawsuit against Epstein, under the pseudonym â€œJane Doe 102â€<9d>, she alleged that her duties included being â€œsexually exploited by Epsteinâ€™s adult male peers including royaltyâ€<9d>. Giuffre reached a $500,000 settlement with Epstein in that case before it went to trial. She also sued and settled for an undisclosed sum with Maxwell in a 2015 defamation suit. Giuffre filed the current civil lawsuit against the duke for sexual abuse, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress just five days short of the closing of a window in New Yorkâ€™s Childâ€™s Sex Act that had been opened to clear a backlog of claims against religious institutions. In the civil case, the decision this week marked a first-round victory against the dukeâ€™s effort to have the case dismissed on the grounds that her agreement with Epstein covered all â€œpotential defendantsâ€<9d>. Kaplan ruled that the the case could proceed. There are still many legal steps in the process before a potential trial. The dukeâ€™s lawyers are likely to argue that Judge Lewis Kaplanâ€™s court is the wrong venue to air Giuffreâ€™s claims because neither party resides in the United States. If such a challenge came down in the dukeâ€™s favor, however, Giuffre is highly unlikely to end her pursuit. â€œI think it takes time to heal, and this justice is part of the process,â€<9d> Giuffre told New York magazine before the decision this week. â€œNow I can start really working past Maxwell and thinking about the others who need to be held accountable.â€<9d> She added: â€œNo matter how rich or how connected you are.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Rolfe is charged with murdering Indigenous man Kumanjayi Walker in the remote community of Yuendumu, about 300km from Alice Springs, in November 2019. He has pleaded not guilty to murder and alternate charges. Here is what the court has heard during the trial. How was Walker shot? The court has heard Rolfe shot Walker three times at a property known as House 511 in Yuendumu at about 7.20pm on 9 November 2019. He had been trying to arrest Walker, a 19-year-old Warlpiri man, in relation to an outstanding warrant. More evidence about the shooting was revealed when Justice John Burns amended previous suppression orders preventing the publication of body-worn camera footage of the shooting played to the court and of detailed descriptions of that footage. Rolfeâ€™s defence does not dispute that he shot Walker â€“ what is in dispute is whether two of those shots were justified in the circumstances. In his opening address, the prosecutor, Phillip Strickland SC, took the jury through body-worn camera footage of the incident. He said Rolfe and fellow constable Adam Eberl had entered House 511 looking for Walker and found him walking towards them. The officers entered via the only working door to the property, meaning Walker could not escape, Strickland said. Strickland said Rolfe and Eberl ushered Walker to his right so his back was against the wall and the officers were in front of him. Rolfe then held his mobile phone, which had a photo of Walker on it, against the right side of Walkerâ€™s face, to confirm his identity. Soon after, he asked Walker to put his hands behind his back. But Walker took a pair of surgical scissors from his pocket and brought them down in a stabbing motion into Rolfeâ€™s left shoulder, the prosecutor said. Strickland said Eberl and Walker struggled towards the other side of the room and Rolfe fired his first shot, hitting Walker in the middle of the back, while the 19-year-old was standing about a metre away. Strickland has told the court that Walker then either fell or was wrestled to the ground by Eberl, who he described as physically larger than Walker. The pair then struggled on a mattress. Strickland told the court Eberl gained control of Walker, who he said was lying on his front and side, with Walkerâ€™s right arm â€“ which had been holding the scissors â€“ pinned underneath him. David Edwardson QC, for Rolfe, disputes that Eberl was in control at this time. The prosecution says Rolfe walked across the room to the couple, placed his left hand on Eberlâ€™s back, and, while standing above Walker, extended his right arm, which was holding his Glock semi-automatic handgun. He pulled the trigger twice more when the barrel of the gun was so close to Walkerâ€™s body that it may have been touching it, Strickland said. According to Strickland, the second shot was fired 2.6 seconds after the first shot and 0.5 seconds before the third. What the prosecution argue â€“ and what Rolfeâ€™s defence will be Rolfe is charged in relation to the second and third shots. Edwardson said Rolfe would defend his actions as being reasonable and justifiable in the context of the danger faced by him and Eberl. He said Rolfe was acting in self-defence and to defend the life of Eberl when he fired the second and third shots â€“ and his actions were supported by his training. The barrister cautioned the jury against placing too much weight on the footage â€“ especially when being shown it multiple times. Edwardson argued Walker had a propensity for violence, having threatened different officers with an axe days earlier, and had attacked Rolfe in a dark and confined space. Rolfe â€œdid not have the luxury of considering tactical options frame by frameâ€<9d>, Edwardson told the court. â€œHe could not press the pause button.â€<9d> Strickland says the prosecution case was not confined to Rolfeâ€™s actions during the shooting but the context in which it took place. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning What was the plan? The trial has heard evidence about what information was provided to Rolfe and his four colleagues from Alice Springs before they travelled to Yuendumu on 9 November 2019. The prosecution argues that evidence â€“ and what the officers knew before they left Yuendumu police station â€“ is essential for establishing the shootingâ€™s context. They argue that the attempt to arrest Walker on the night he was shot was inconsistent with a plan to arrest him the following day. Sgt Julie Frost, the officer in charge of Yuendumu station, gave evidence that an email described as the operational plan was sent to four of the officers and other police about two hours before they arrived in Yuendumu. But the officers were already on their way from Alice Springs and would not have had mobile phone reception to check their emails for most of the journey, the court heard. Frost says she anticipated this and printed out copies for the officers, which she made available at the station when they arrived. She says she gave the officers a briefing about the contents of the plan, which included details of their duties that night, and mentioned the officers would meet back at the station at 5am the following day to prepare for Walkerâ€™s arrest. Two of the Alice Springs-based officers who were in the five-minute briefing and have given evidence, however, recall few details of the briefing and have denied seeing the plan prepared by Frost. Another officer, the dog handler Adam Donaldson, who arrived before the four officers from the Immediate Response Team (IRT) which included Rolfe, said he was given a copy of the plan by Frost. Frost told the court there was no intelligence on where Walker was, as he had not been seen by police since he threatened two local officers with an axe on 6 November. She had told his family and community elders that he should hand himself in, and given him until after a funeral to be held in the community on 9 November to do so, but did not believe he would surrender. She said she had told the officers they should gather intelligence on where Walker was while they were patrolling the community on the night of 9 November and that if they came across him that night they should arrest him. Edwardson says the plan, even if it had have been seen by the officers, contained multiple flaws, including that it mentioned their deployment was not expected until 11pm (about four hours after they were actually ready to deploy) and that there was no intelligence about Walkerâ€™s location, meaning he could not be arrested the following morning as police did not know where he was. He has also sought to emphasise that in policing all plans need to be fluid to respond to changing circumstances. Regardless of what the officers knew before leaving the Yuendumu station, one thing is not in dispute: 15 minutes later Walker was shot. The relevance of police training The prosecution alleges Rolfe acted against his training by drawing his gun while clearing a house during an earlier search for Walker; by allegedly failing to issue verbal commands during his confrontation with Walker; in how he used his weapon during this confrontation, and, along with the other officers involved, by not using cordon and contain techniques once they learned where Walker could be on the night of the shooting. Eberl, the prosecution alleges, was gaining â€œground controlâ€<9d> of Walker, as he had been trained to do, when Rolfe fired the second and third shots. As a member of the IRT, Rolfe had received more weapons and tactical training than general duties officers. The defence also considers police training to be important in the case, for different reasons. â€œHe made a split-second decision to fire shots two and three, as we suggest, consistent with his training, he was required to do,â€<9d> Edwardson said on the second day of the trial. Most police witnesses, of which there have been more than a dozen, have been asked by Edwardson about whether they were familiar with the phrase â€œedged weapon equals gunâ€<9d>, meaning police can draw their firearms once someone presents an edged weapon. They have also been asked about training in relation to the safe distance they should try to maintain from a subject with an edged weapon. Edwardson has also asked about training in relation to where officers are told to shoot offenders â€“ at the central body mass. Walkerâ€™s final days The court has heard evidence about Walkerâ€™s final days in Yuendumu, including from several family members who say he told them he planned to surrender. Eddie Robertson, the grandfather of Walkerâ€™s partner, Rickisha Robertson, and a respected local elder, said he told Walker after the axe incident on 6 November that he had to surrender. Walker, who the court has heard was quietly spoken, nodded in response, Robertson said at the trial. Louanna Williams, Walkerâ€™s aunt, said he also visited her after the axe incident and told her he planned to hand himself in after the funeral of a family member. She said Walker also told her he was â€œcomfortableâ€<9d> having her brother, senior Aboriginal community police officer Derek Williams â€“ who was not involved in the events around Walkerâ€™s death â€“ arrest him and that he denied any involvement in a series of break-ins in Yuendumu. Local police suspected Walker had been involved in the break-ins which had prompted medical staff to leave the town. The break-ins and evacuation were both among the reasons used to justify the deployment of Rolfe and other officers from Alice Springs. The funeral was for the uncle of Leanne Oldfield, Walkerâ€™s adopted mother. Oldfield told the court that minutes before the shooting, she had been sitting outside House 511. She said Walker had been looking at a family photo of his cousins and an aunt in a swimming pool and laughing, she said, before he went inside the property. â€œSoon as he went inside, I seen the police coming through the gate,â€<9d> Oldfield told the court.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

YES!!! No, wait, donâ€™t go: todayâ€™s votes matter not only because of the usual issues (bins, potholes, housing) â€“ but also because weâ€™re in a cost of living crisis where local government has control of many of the levers that can affect it. And then thereâ€™s the national picture â€“ in particular Boris Johnsonâ€™s security as prime minister -that the results will help us to understand. Tomorrow, results will come in from more than 6,800 seats in 200 local authorities, and the big parties â€“ having downplayed their chances in advance â€“ will furiously seek to present the outcome as a success. For today weâ€™re asking: do voters care about Partygate? Is Keir Starmer making an impression? And what about the constitutional questions in play in Scotland and Northern Ireland? Guardian reporters tell us what theyâ€™ve been hearing on the ground about all of this â€“ right after the headlines. Five big stories Ukraine | A Ukrainian commander in the Mariupol steelworks said fierce fighting was underway late last night. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen proposed a total EU ban on Russian oil imports, a major escalation in sanctions. Abortion | As the US supreme court threatens to strike down the right to abortion, Joe Biden has said LGBTQ+ children could be the next targets of a Trump-dominated Republican party he called â€œthis Maga crowdâ€<9d> and â€œthe most extreme political organisation â€¦ in recent American historyâ€<9d>. Cost of living | Shoppers can deal with the cost of living crisis by choosing value brands in the supermarket, the environment secretary suggested. George Eustice said that by doing so people â€œcan actually contain and manage their household budgetâ€<9d>. Climate crisis | A climate-sceptic thinktank, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, has received funding from groups with oil and gas interests despite insisting that it remains independent from the fossil fuel industry. The thinktank has led a backlash against the governmentâ€™s net zero policies. US | Amber Heard told a court that her ex-husband Johnny Depp abused drugs and said the first time he hit her it â€œchanged my lifeâ€<9d>. Heard is testifying in Deppâ€™s lawsuit against her for claiming she was a victim of domestice abuse. In depth: Big questions in the local elections *** How much will voters be motivated by Partygate? Boris Johnson is unlikely to collect the rubbish whoever voters choose on Thursday â€“ but that doesnâ€™t mean he isnâ€™t on their minds. One theme to emerge from the Guardianâ€™s battleground dispatches is quite how many people have been turned off by Partygate. Efforts by local Conservatives to distance themselves from Johnson lead the print edition of the Guardian this morning. Take a look at this Hartlepool leaflet as an example: Political correspondent Aubrey Allegretti heard plenty about all this when he visited the London borough of Wandsworth, a flagship Tory council which is now a credible target for Labour. He recalls a conversation with one Conservative voter, who told him that â€œwhile [the party is] led by a man I donâ€™t consider has integrity, I wouldnâ€™t vote for them.â€<9d> Aubrey thinks allegations of lockdown rule-breaking at No 10 could â€œcontribute significantlyâ€<9d> to how the Tories perform there. He said he was â€œquite surprised by how tactical some natural Tory voters are. They seemed ready to accept some short-term pain locally in exchange for what they see as the long-term gain of getting Johnson out.â€<9d> Similarly, Heather Stewartâ€™s piece yesterday from Worthing, West Sussex, feels like more evidence for Labour optimism in former Tory strongholds in the south. â€œI think [Partygate] may have an effect on turnout,â€<9d> the Toriesâ€™ deputy council leader Edward Crouch told her. â€œOur voters donâ€™t vote against us very often, they just stay at home and shout at the telly.â€<9d> In many other parts of the country, Partygate appears to be actively motivating people in the opposite direction. â€œIâ€™m voting Labour for the first time ever,â€<9d> one voter in Bridgend told Steven Morris. â€œEvery time I see Boris the buffoon, it makes me more sure. Heâ€™s lied and lied.â€<9d> *** Do voters see Keir Starmer as a credible alternative? Unfortunately for Labour, there are quite a lot of voters feeling enthusiastically rude about Keir Starmer, too â€“ or simply viewing him as a non-entity. â€œThereâ€™s a big poll lead nationally and we are getting a hearing again, but Iâ€™m still not sensing that love on the ground,â€<9d> one Labour figure told Josh Halliday in Sunderland, where the party fears losing a council itâ€™s held since its creation in 1974. Loretta Anthony, a 61-year-old Labour supporter in Bury, was pithier still in Jessica Elgotâ€™s piece: â€œIâ€™m sorry to say I donâ€™t like the guy. We really need someone with a bit of backbone.â€<9d> â€œIt was striking that some longtime Labour supporters donâ€™t think heâ€™s opposing the government forcefully enough,â€<9d> said Jessica, kindly breaking into a precious day off to speak to me, and only occasionally pausing to ask her toddler to please stop taking the leaves off a nearby bush. â€œAnd Keir Starmer as a person â€“ it didnâ€™t seem like people think about him as the barrister whoâ€™s taken on the Stephen Lawrence case, or McDonaldâ€™s â€“ they think heâ€™s some corporate lawyer.â€<9d> Most predictions suggest Labour will make some progress â€“ but, as Robert Ford wrote in the Observer, â€œThe bulk of this yearâ€™s English contests are being fought on Labourâ€™s strongest terrain â€“ London and other big cities â€“ meaning more seats to defend and fewer opportunities for gains.â€<9d> Rather than seats, Jessica said, â€œthe thing thatâ€™s interesting about places like Bury from a national perspective is vote share. If they canâ€™t win parliamentary seats in Bury at the next general election, they may as well go home. Itâ€™s not a big headline, but gaining one or two councillors would indicate that theyâ€™re on course.â€<9d> *** Who will lead opposition to the SNP in Scotland? If the dynamics in England and Wales seem complicated enough, consider the lot of the Guardianâ€™s Scotland editor Severin Carrell. With every council seat north of the border in play, heâ€™s sorting through the vagaries of the single transferrable vote system - which can lead to outcomes unthinkable in parts of the UK where votes for Labour and Conservatives are binary opposites. While the nuances in different parts of Scotland are vast, Severin says that â€œthe most obvious single dynamic here is Labour against Tory â€“ who is going to be top of the parties that are against the SNPâ€<9d>, the governing party which has endured a period of steady decline in the polls but remains first by a distance. â€œIt improves Labourâ€™s chances in Scotland that it jumps the hurdle of being electable at a UK level,â€<9d> he said. â€œWorking-class unionist swing voters may have jumped ship last time around because they didnâ€™t believe that about Jeremy Corbyn.â€<9d> As Severin set out in this piece, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has argued that at 27%, the partyâ€™s rough level of support in recent polls, a number of seats will come back into play in the next general election. For the Scottish Tories, whose leader Douglas Ross has â€œgone through really embarrassing contortions recently over the suitability of Boris Johnson to be PMâ€<9d>, the question is how many seats will they lose. The SNP, meanwhile, are insulated from serious harm: they underperformed in 2017, and canâ€™t lose any of the councils they currently run. In summary, Severin said, â€œwhatever happens probably isnâ€™t going to change the political weatherâ€<9d>. *** Will Northern Ireland get its first nationalist leader? In Northern Ireland, the vote is for members of the executive Stormont Assembly rather than councils. If polls are right, Ireland correspondent Rory Carroll says, Sinn FÃ©in should emerge as the largest party â€“ an outcome portrayed by the Democratic Unionist party as damaging for the union. â€œThe Sinn FÃ©in bogeyman is useful as a tool for the DUP to stop people turning to other unionist parties,â€<9d> Rory said yesterday. â€œItâ€™s worked in the past. The polling suggests that it wonâ€™t this time.â€<9d> Thatâ€™s part of why Sinn FÃ©inâ€™s leader in Northern Ireland Michelle Oâ€™Neill is taking a cautious approach on campaign messaging, as Rory explains in this piece. â€œPro-union voters are not sufficiently scared to flock to the DUP because they mostly recognise there is no prospect of an Irish unity referendum in the short term,â€<9d> Rory said. â€œAnd Sinn FÃ©in have stopped talking about it themselves.â€<9d> Thatâ€™s not to underestimate the symbolic significance of a first Sinn FÃ©in first minister â€“ especially if the combined vote for all nationalist parties comes out ahead of unionist support. But Rory emphasises that itâ€™s complicated: â€œSinn FÃ©in may make this pretty momentous breakthrough and yet actually lose seats, just because the DUP does worse,â€<9d> he said, adding: â€œGood luck explaining that pithily.â€<9d> Thanks Rory! (And if Iâ€™ve failed, do read his hugely interesting exploration of what the election might mean for unionism in the Observer.) What else weâ€™ve been reading The ten leading US feminists who give their responses to a new supreme court threat to abortion rights sound horrified, but not surprised.

Which makes sense because growing up I saw the moana as just a body of water. Nothing special. And sadly, thatâ€™s how I saw myself. I am a descendant of NgÄ<81>puhi and grew up in Te Tai Tokerau with Waipu beach at my doorstep. I spent hours on the boat out at Langs beach, taking day trips as a child to Ninety Mile beach, the Hokianga, Cape Reinga and all the untamed places my ancestors landed on when they first arrived in Aotearoa. Despite being surrounded by oceans of water growing up, the moana was just somewhere I went to because Mum forced me. Mum said I almost drowned a few times so maybe thatâ€™s got something to do with it. I hated the feeling of being cold, of being smashed around by the waves and feeling unsafe. My relationship with the moana began to change as my relationship with myself became more defined. Last year I undertook a full-immersion te reo MÄ<81>ori course and it was the hardest year of my life. I began to unravel hidden parts of myself that I didnâ€™t know existed through learning a language beaten from my ancestors. Emotions began to surface that felt beyond my control and I would hear the whispering to go to the moana. At the time, I couldnâ€™t understand why. I live 40 minutes from Piha beach and it was the middle of winter. It didnâ€™t make sense. I listened to the promptings, jumped in my car, and the rain pounded on the windscreen as I drove to what became my Ä<81>huru mÅ<8d>wai â€“ my safe haven. Itâ€™s strange to think that despite growing up around the moana and being spoiled with choice, it was a black sand beach tucked away in Waitakere that became my favourite wild place in Aotearoa. You drive along the windy roads, get around the bend and see the cliff-top view of the ocean, and you breathe in the sight and say â€œwoahâ€<9d> to yourself even though youâ€™ve seen it many times. You pull up to the car park and thereâ€™s the rock that looks like a lion that reminds you Piha is wild and dangerous and there have been many deaths. The waves are imposing and the rips will get you if youâ€™re not careful. The first time last year I went to Piha, it was pouring down with rain. Tangaroa is the God of the Moana and he is very much a life force. I said a karakia to him and dived into the water. When I came out of the moana, I felt light and connected. It was Tangaroa rejuvenating my spirit. I learnt that when you swim in the moana, youâ€™re surrounded by his love. He caught my hopes and dreams and swept away my tears all at the same time. As the challenges of learning te reo MÄ<81>ori came, I escaped to Piha and gave it all to Tangaroa. It soon became a regular routine. It didnâ€™t matter what emotions I was feeling or what I was going through, Tangaroa seemed to understand me. And slowly, my view of myself began to change. This year I didnâ€™t just reclaim my language â€“ I reclaimed my relationship with myself through the moana. Piha beach is rugged and moody and beautiful and imperfect. It is also a taonga (treasure). And thatâ€™s how I see myself now. Thereâ€™s nowhere else in the world like it.

Yet you talk as if you were my personal psychiatrist with consistent and uninterrupted access to my instincts.â€<9d> Marr responded to Morrisseyâ€™s open letter, writing on Twitter: â€œAn â€˜open letterâ€™ hasnâ€™t really been a thing since 1953, Itâ€™s all â€˜social mediaâ€™ now. Even Donald J Trump had that one down. Also, this fake news businessâ€¦a bit 2021 yeah?â€<9d> Marr is promoting a new solo album, Fever Dreams Pts 1-4. His offending remarks appear to come from the March 2022 issue of Uncut magazine, in which he mentions Morrissey in a discussion about collaboration. â€œIt wonâ€™t come as any surprise when I say that Iâ€™m really close with everyone Iâ€™ve worked with â€“ except for the obvious one,â€<9d> he said. â€œAnd that isnâ€™t that much of a surprise because weâ€™re so different, me and Morrissey.â€<9d> Marr is a left-wing, teetotal vegan who runs 10 miles a day. Morrissey has descended into infamy for his remarks on race and politics. After Stormzy headlined Glastonbury in 2019, Morrissey shared a video that accused the British establishment of using the rapper to promote multiculturalism at the expense of British culture, which Morrissey posted under the title: â€œNothing but blue skies for Stormzy â€¦ the gallows for Morrissey.â€<9d> He has frequently denied accusations of racism. He has referred to Hitler as â€œleft wingâ€<9d>, praised Brexit, expressed support for the far-right political party For Britain, criticised sexual assault survivors and said that immigration diminishes British identity. In 2019, Liverpoolâ€™s Merseyrail transport network removed posters advertising his album California Son following a complaint from the member of the public regarding his views. In the open letter, Morrissey accused Marr of hypocrisy. â€œYou found me inspirational enough to make music with me for six years. If I was, as you claim, such an eyesore monster, where exactly did this leave you? Kidnapped? Mute? Chained? Abducted by cross-eyed extraterrestrials? It was YOU who played guitar on Golden Lights â€“ not me. â€œYes, we all know that the British press will print anything you say about me as long as itâ€™s cruel and savage. But youâ€™ve done all that. Move on.â€<9d> Morrissey pointed out that the pair havenâ€™t been close for 35 years, â€œwhich is many lifetimes ago. When we met you and I were not successful. We both helped each other become whatever it is we are today. â€œCan you not just leave it at that? Must you persistently, year after year, decade after decade, blame me for everything â€¦ from the 2007 Solomon Islands tsunami to the dribble on your grandmaâ€™s chin?â€<9d> He told Marr to move on and â€œtake responsibility for your own actions and your own career, with which I wish you good health to enjoyâ€<9d>. â€œJust stop using my name as click-bait. I have not ever attacked your solo work or your solo life, and I have openly applauded your genius during the days of Louder Than Bombs and Strangeways, Here We Come, yet you have positioned yourself ever-ready as rent-a-quote whenever the press require an ugly slant on something I half-said during the last glacial period as the Colorado River began to carve out the Grand Canyon.â€<9d> Marr is not exactly voluble on the matter of Morrissey, and generally approaches journalistsâ€™ and fansâ€™ curiosity about their relationship â€“ and evident differences of politics and personality â€“ with a measure of diplomacy. In 2019, Marr told NME he wasnâ€™t concerned about Morrisseyâ€™s controversial views affecting the legacy of the Smiths. â€œI donâ€™t think you can change history â€¦ Iâ€™m not worried. Itâ€™s got nothing to do with my world or my life. The songs are out there for people to judge, relate to and hear. I think thatâ€™s all going to be forgotten in a few weeks, as these things inevitably are â€“ for better or worse.â€<9d> That same year, he told the Independent that he and Morrissey werenâ€™t still friends and repeated the line â€“ as he often does â€“ about them being â€œvery different â€¦ but everyone knows that!

Storm Eunice will make Friday a treacherous day for most of the UK. The storm is hot on the heels of Storm Dudley which arrived on Wednesday afternoon with strong winds battering Northern Ireland, southern Scotland and northern England. As of 5pm, Capel Curig in Wales had experienced gusts of up to 81mph, with Emley Moore in Yorkshire seeing 74mph winds, while Drumalbin in Scotland was hit by 71mph gales. Eunice, the Met Office said, â€œcould see even more dangerous weather conditions, with extremely strong winds expected for the southern half of the UK, especially in exposed coastal areas in the south and west.â€<9d> Chief meteorologist Frank Saunders said an active jet stream was helping to drive the low pressure systems across the UK. â€œSignificant disruption is possible from both Storm Dudley and Storm Eunice with strong winds one of the main themes of the current forecast,â€<9d> he said. â€œStorm Eunice is expected to track eastwards from early on Friday, bringing the most significant winds to the central and southern areas of the UK, with some gusts possible in excess of 95mph in exposed coastal areas.â€<9d> An amber, previously yellow, weather warning for Friday has been issued covering Wales, southern England and the Midlands. A yellow warning of wind and heavy snow as a result of Eunice on Friday was in place for northern England, southern Scotland and Northern Ireland. About 5cm of snow is predicted at low levels and up to 30cm above 250m. East Midlands Railway and London North Eastern Railway have warned customers to expect disruption to services in the coming days, with LNER asking passengers planning to travel on Friday to move their journey because of the weather. Rod Dennis, spokesperson for RAC Breakdown, said: â€œDrivers should take the fact the Met Office has upweighted its warnings from yellow to amber on Friday very seriously. Storm Eunice will make road conditions hazardous, so we strongly urge drivers not to risk it and instead consider delaying their journeys until the storm passes.â€<9d> Quite how bad the predicted storms will be remains to be seen. John Swinney, Scotlandâ€™s deputy first minister, said the coming days would be â€œvery challengingâ€<9d> and urged everyone to plan their journeys in advance, exercise caution on the roads, and follow the latest travel advice. ScotRail said as a safety precaution the vast majority of services would be wound down by 4pm on Wednesday, when the worst of Storm Dudley was expected. Avanti West Coast urged passengers travelling north of Preston to do so before 4pm and said ticket restrictions would be removed. Wednesday tickets could be used on Thursday, it said. The Dudley amber weather warning included â€œinjuries and danger to lifeâ€<9d> from large waves and beach material being thrown on to coastal roads and seafronts. Power firms said they were prepared after storms Arwen, Malik and Corrie caused widespread power cuts. Northern Powergrid said there was a relatively high likelihood of disruption to power supplies. Paul Glendinning, the director of policy and markets, said the company had ensured resources were in place to respond to the storms. â€œOur network control engineers have capability to restore power supplies remotely, switching electricity through alternative routes on our network wherever possible to get customers back on supply,â€<9d> he said. â€œIn parallel our frontline workforce will be deployed to carry out local switching and repairs to restore power as safely and quickly as the conditions allow.â€<9d> Northumberland fire and rescue service urged people to be prepared. That included having batteries for torches and radios and some food that did not need cooking, charging phones and checking in on elderly and disabled neighbours. The chief fire officer, Paul Hedley, advised residents not to go out in the storms unless it was absolutely necessary. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution asked people to stay well back from stormy seas and cliff edges. If there was any light relief in the storm warnings it was in the names. David Baddiel tweeted: â€œIâ€™m not convinced that a storm called Dudley, or indeed one called Eunice, presage a sense of devastation. I think they presage a sense that these storms might offer you a nice cup of tea.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

You would think that would be an enormous story, right? I mean, a celebrity caught sneezing is considered newsworthy (the actor Jennifer Garner, in case you missed it). Wrong. Coverage of the detention of Brittney Griner, a star player in the Womenâ€™s National Basketball Association (WNBA) and a two-time Olympic champion, was until very recently so sparse that there is a good chance this is the first time you are hearing about it. If so, here is the background: on 17 February, Griner, who plays for the Russian team UMMC Ekaterinburg during the WNBA offseason, was arrested at an airport near Moscow. The 31-year-old was accused by Russian customs authorities of having vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage. She faces up to 10 years in prison. That would be a nightmare for anyone, but it doesnâ€™t help that Griner is black and openly gay. Russia, I donâ€™t need to tell you, is hardly an LGBTQ+ paradise. There has been a lot of outrage on social media about the fact that Grinerâ€™s detention hasnâ€™t been bigger news. Some of that online outrage (shockingly!) is misplaced. The people firing off indignant tweets along the lines of â€œWHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT BRITTNEY?â€<9d> could have answered their own question if they had done five minutes of Googling. The Washington Post, for example, reports that people familiar with the case have explained that Grinerâ€™s arrest has been kept quiet deliberately because of worries that high-profile coverage could make her more valuable to Russia and jeopardise her release. If that is the case, why am I writing about Griner? Well, because the keep-it-quiet strategy hasnâ€™t worked and US lawmakers are now openly discussing the situation. The athleteâ€™s detention was first reported by the New York Times on 5 March and has been snowballing into a bigger story since â€“ not least because Russian state TV has started broadcasting mugshots of the athlete. The genie is out of the bottle; it is useless to pretend otherwise. While it is not clear whether Griner, who was detained days before Russia invaded Ukraine, was arrested for political reasons, her situation has certainly been politicised. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat representing Grinerâ€™s home state of Texas, recently told the news website the Hill, for example, that she believes the arrest was â€œtargeted and purposefulâ€<9d>. CNN is running headlines proclaiming that her arrest is the â€œmost audacious hostage-taking by a state imaginableâ€<9d>. There are a lot of unknowns about Grinerâ€™s detention, but here is one thing we do know: she wouldnâ€™t have been in Russia if womenâ€™s sports were more respected in the US. Griner reportedly earns more than $1m (Â£770,000) a season playing for UMMC Ekaterinburg; almost five times the $221,450 she got in base pay to play in the US last season and almost 10 times more than the average WNBA salary of $130,000. While that money is obviously nothing to sniff at, it is peanuts compared with what the male players get. Stephen Curry, the highest-paid player in the NBA, is reportedly earning $45.8m this season. Griner wasnâ€™t the only WNBA star supplementing her income by taking on work in Russia; it is common practice. In 2015, UMMC Ekaterinburg even paid the basketball star Diana Taurasi to sit out the WNBA season so she could be fresh for the Russian season. â€œWe had to go to a communist country to get paid like capitalists, which is so backward to everything that was in the history books in sixth grade,â€<9d> Taurasi complained. Russia hasnâ€™t been a communist country for decades, of course, but her point is well taken. I donâ€™t know what the history books of the future will say about the current era (there is a helluva lot to be said!), but I do hope they wonâ€™t pretend that sports are apolitical. Griner has got a lot of flak in recent years for walking off court during the national anthem in protest against police brutality. Sports shouldnâ€™t be political, a lot of people said. I hope the terrible Ukraine crisis, and the reverberations it has had around the world, has been a wakeup call to these people: everything is political.",FALSE,"pillar/opinion","Opinion"

Girls aged between 13 and 15 were trafficked, prostituted, raped and assaulted by the gang. One victim was forced to have sex with at least 20 men in one night; another was forced to drink vodka, and was vomiting over the side of the bed while being raped by â€œcountless menâ€<9d>. The perpetrators would pass the girls to their friends, often to settle a debt. The victims, many of whom were from difficult backgrounds and therefore particularly vulnerable, were plied with drugs, alcohol and fast food, and then taken to â€œchill housesâ€<9d> across the north of England to be abused. One 13-year-old victim became pregnant and had an abortion. Some of the men involved were arrested, tried and found guilty. But not all. One of the victims â€“ given the fictitious name Amber in Three Girls, the BBC One drama about the abuse â€“ was 14 when she was targeted by gang members. After a troubled upbringing, Amber had been placed on the child protection register as being at risk of sexual and emotional abuse and neglect. Craving love and attention, Amber was lured into a nightmare, subjected to repeated and often violent sexual abuse. That nightmare should have ended with the arrest and trial of the perpetrators, but instead the police, Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and even social services treated her not as a victim but as a perpetrator. Last Tuesday Amber, with two other victims of the Rochdale grooming gang, finally received an apology delivered personally by Stephen Watson, the chief constable of Greater Manchester police (GMP). Their treatment encompasses a range of catastrophic errors in one of the countryâ€™s most harrowing child sexual abuse scandals. When we met in a hotel in Rochdale last month, Amber was accompanied by Maggie Oliver, a former police detective who walked out of the job in protest at the way Amber had been treated. In 2009, when Amber was 16, uniformed officers arrived at her motherâ€™s house, arrested her and took her to the police station. â€œ[I] canâ€™t remember exactly what they said, but it was something along the lines of being a â€˜madamâ€™,â€<9d> she recalled. â€œI didnâ€™t know what that meant.â€<9d> She was held in custody for hours before being released on bail. Her mother was not allowed to be with her during the interview, and there was no mention of an appropriate adult. Amber had, under pressure from the abusers, taken some of her friends to the takeaway where the ringleaders operated from. She told me: â€œIt wasnâ€™t like a forced thing. It was like a casual, â€˜Oh, bring your friends.â€™â€<9d> She was a vulnerable child, being sexually abused, controlled and in fear. No further action was taken against Amber, but it would be another two years before the CPS agreed that she should be treated as a victim and witness rather than a suspect. During that period, Amber â€“ by now pregnant and living in a one-room flat â€“ continued to be targeted by the grooming gangs. Although police interviewed a total of 56 men on suspicion of abuse, only a handful were tried. There were therefore many still walking free that had evaded detection. Amber was also threatened at gunpoint by a man whom she subsequently identified to the police. Nothing happened. She told me: â€œPolice werenâ€™t arsed with us, really. They werenâ€™t bothered â€¦ when youâ€™re from a shit home. They donâ€™t give a fuck when youâ€™re not from a wealthy background.â€<9d> It was only when she met Oliver in early 2012 that things started to change. Oliver had been headhunted to join the grooming gangs case as detective and victim liaison officer in 2010 because of her experience working with vulnerable victims. Amber was understandably reluctant to trust the police. But once the CPS advised the GMP that she was no longer seen as a suspect, she was persuaded by Oliver to begin a series of video interviews and ID parades. I asked Amber what gave her the strength to give evidence to the police, after what she had gone through. She told me: â€œSo it didnâ€™t happen to anybody else. I didnâ€™t want other people to feel how I felt.â€<9d> Her courage and Oliverâ€™s support resulted in a database of abusers whom she identified by names, car registrations, telephone numbers and addresses. It formed a large part of the police investigation that became known as Operation Span. The ID parades were particularly gruelling for Amber, who did 12 in one day alone, correctly identifying 10 of her abusers. Afterwards, she told me: â€œI went home, put it to the back of my mind to be honest. Iâ€™ve got a box in the back of my head, and I just put it all in there and itâ€™s locked away.â€<9d> But before what turned out to be the final interview, Oliver says she started to notice a change in tone from senior officers, and felt they were now deliberately trying to push this victim away. Then, shortly after the ID parade, Oliver was told that they were no longer going to â€œuseâ€<9d> Amberâ€™s evidence. She walked out, refusing to go along with this decision, and was forbidden from speaking to Amber. The period during the buildup to the trial of the men accused of being part of the grooming gang, was dark for Amber. She says she was never informed by police either that she was no longer being treated as a victim, or that none of those she alleged to be her abusers was to be prosecuted for her abuse. The trial of nine of the grooming gang was pending, and in the meantime, despite never having been informed, arrested or cautioned, Amber was added to the indictment by the CPS as a co-conspirator. Without Amberâ€™s initial evidence there might never have been a trial at all. She gave the police a list, at an early stage of Operation Span, with nicknames, telephone numbers and other details relating to offenders. She later went on to positively identify a number of offenders, which enabled charges to be brought against them all. But in court, she was portrayed by the prosecution and defence as an assistant pimp. Because she was not involved in the trial, and therefore did not give evidence, she had no opportunity to defend herself. She was vilified and nicknamed in the press as the â€œHoney Monsterâ€<9d>. Although a court order prevented her being named, everyone in her local community knew who she was. After the court case, social services started to pursue Amber, with the aim of having her children removed. Just before the due date of her second baby, she was called to the family court, where an application was made to remove both children on the grounds that Amber was an abuser and a danger to children. Finally, after a gruelling 18 months and several hearings, the judge threw the case out. Five years later she won an apology and compensation from social services. In 2019, Amber, along with two other victims, with the help of the Centre for Womenâ€™s Justice, issued a civil claim for damages against GMP and the director of public prosecutions (DPP). While GMP has finally settled the claim, which includes the personal apology from the chief constable, the DPP has so far resisted. In response to Amberâ€™s claim that it was wrong to name her on the indictment, it says it was â€œboth legally and tactically the correct course to takeâ€<9d>. To date, the CPS has not accepted any failure on its part and instead continues to herald this case as the first successful prosecution of a grooming gang. While this is true, Amber believes that she was used as a scapegoat. â€œWhat the police and CPS did to me was worse than the abuse â€¦ The apology will be a kind of a weight lifted from me.â€<9d> But the nightmare will never really be over. Amber still sees those whom she says raped, beat and tortured her, out and about in Rochdale. â€œOne delivered a takeaway to my house a few weeks back,â€<9d> she tells me. Finally, she has been exonerated. She has forced the police and social services to apologise to her for their behaviour. â€œI agreed to help the police to stop it happening to others,â€<9d> Amber wrote to Oliver in the midst of her campaign for justice. â€œI trusted police â€¦ that I would be helped this time. I gave hours of interviews, reliving all the abuse. I felt sick, got upset â€¦ nothing never no one from police came to me to explain why I was no longer going to court. Not one charged never, why? â€œMy name has been dragged through the mud. I push thoughts about the abuse out of my head. And Iâ€™ve done nothing wrong â€“ I was a victim of these men at the age of 14. I shouldâ€™ve been helped, not punished.â€<9d> The NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

One morning in September 2009 it was there, coating Daniel Sandaâ€™s modest seaweed farm on the Indonesian island of Rote: a dark sheen across the water, waxy yellow-grey blocks floating in the sea. Within days, the crop his family depended on for its livelihood turned white and died. It has still not fully recovered. The oil came swiftly, but Sandaâ€™s fight for justice has been grindingly slow. And he is far from alone. More than a decade after the catastrophic oil spill, thousands of farmers who say they are victims of one of Australiaâ€™s worst environmental disasters are still seeking acknowledgment and compensation. In 2010 an Australian government inquiry found that the Montara oil spill was no misfortune, but the result of corporate neglect: â€œan accident waiting to happenâ€<9d>. The commission found that the Australian subsidiary of the Thai oil company PTTEP was negligent in its operation of the Montara oilwell, 250km off the coast of Western Australia, which exploded in August 2009. The federal court would later find that it had spewed more than 2,500 barrels of oil into the Timor Sea every day for 74 days. The resulting slick killed seaweed crops, destroyed fishing grounds and polluted waters over more than 90,000 sq km, an area larger than Tasmania. In March 2021, the federal court ordered the Australian subsidiary PTTEP Australasia (PTTEPAA) to pay Sanda a little over A$34,000 in damages. So far he has not received anything. In December, the company lodged an appeal, arguing there was insufficient evidence of Montara oil in the coastal areas of Rote and Kupang. The company and Sandaâ€™s representatives have been ordered to undertake mediation. Since 2016, Sanda has been the lead plaintiff of a class action, the representative of 15,483 seaweed farmers seeking compensation for lost livelihoods and opportunities. But there are thousands more outside this group who say they have been affected by the spill â€“ fishers, farmers and families â€“ and who have received no apology or compensation. Ferdi Tanoni, the chairman of West Timor Care Foundation, says people are still suffering, from islands as far afield as Sabu, East Flores, Lembata and Sumba. The federal courtâ€™s decision in Sandaâ€™s case was limited to the regions of Rote and Kupang, and PTTEP denies oil from the spill reached Indonesia. Tanoni has spent years crisscrossing the islands in the east of the Indonesian archipelago, advocating on behalf of those who claim they were affected. â€œIt is over 100,000 people who have been affected. In some places, the crops they get are now maybe 10%, 15% of [what they were getting] before [the disaster]. There are many, many schoolchildren who donâ€™t go to school any more because there isnâ€™t any money. â€œItâ€™s not like it used to be. Itâ€™s a very, very hard life now.â€<9d> In December, Tanoni travelled to Jakarta for a meeting of the Montara taskforce, the beginning, he hoped, of potential negotiations over a settlement. At the last minute, the meeting was postponed; progress stalled again. Seaweed built houses, met bills In January 2009, PTTEPAA chose to plug one of four wells in its newly drilled Montara oilfield in the Timor Sea, 700km from Darwin and 240km from the Indonesian island of Rote. The 2010 inquiry found the job was done carelessly and incompetently: the company did not come â€œwithin a â€˜bullâ€™s roarâ€™ of sensible oilfield practiceâ€<9d>. Three control barriers used to cap the well had not been tested, all were deficient and one had not been properly installed. â€œThe blowout was not a reflection of one unfortunate incident, or of bad luck. What happened with the H1 Well was an accident waiting to happen; the companyâ€™s systems and processes were so deficient and its key personnel so lacking in basic competence, that the blowout can properly be said to have been an event waiting to occur,â€<9d> the inquiry found. The blowout sent uncontrolled plumes of oil rushing into the sea. The company claimed the leak was equivalent to 400 barrels of oil a day â€“ the actual figure, the federal court found in its decision in Sandaâ€™s case, was more than 2,500 barrels each day. By the time the blowout was arrested, after 74 days, oil had spread over more than 90,000 sq km. Eighty-one villages on Rote Island and around the city of Kupang on Timor were hit by the slick. It was a month after the Montara blowout when the oil arrived in the waters off Rote, late in September 2009 â€“ yellow-grey blocks about the size of golf balls floating in a once-clear sea that was now glossy and dark. The sea smelled pungently of oil and was filled with dead fish. In three days, Sandaâ€™s seaweed crop turned white and died. Seaweed farming was a critical industry for thousands in the region. Since 2000, Indonesia had emerged as the worldâ€™s dominant source of raw, dried seaweed, and the eastern islands of the archipelago were a key source. The industry had proved an economic boon to villages along thousands of kilometres of coastline. Families who had previously eked out a subsistence existence through farming and fishing found economic stability through a growing global demand for their product. Indonesian seaweed was used in food, fertilisers, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. More than half the households in the region relied exclusively on seaweed farming for income. Seaweed built houses, met hospital bills, put children through school. The farmers who gave evidence in Sandaâ€™s case said the oil that arrived after the Montara spill killed it all and that, although now growing again, the seaweed has never fully recovered. Sanda told the court he had been introduced to seaweed farming by the local bupati â€“ government official â€“ who encouraged him to mark out a plot at Inggurae Beach on Rote Island, growing seaweed from seed on long ropes in the water. The income he earned paid for Sanda to add brick walls and a kitchen to his home, to buy furniture and a motorbike, and to send his children to university. He donated money to his church. All over his village, families rode the wave of economic development. â€œBefore the oil came, my seaweed crops were rich and healthy, and the income from seaweed harvesting was good,â€<9d> Sanda says. â€œIn 2009, after the oil came, my seaweed became white and weak, then fell down and was washed away by the current.â€<9d> â€˜Accurate and honest accountsâ€™ Justice David Yates of the federal court said Sanda had suffered â€œa very significant lossâ€<9d> that devastated his income and destroyed his familyâ€™s way of life for years. The company accepted it had been negligent in its operation of the well, but argued the oil lost did not reach Indonesian waters and, if it did, its concentration was not toxic enough to destroy the seaweed crops. The company also denied it owed a duty of care to the farmers. Its lawyers argued the farmersâ€™ evidence was unreliable, saying their memories had been contaminated by â€œconsensusâ€<9d> versions of the facts they had discussed with one another. This was rejected by Yates, who said the seaweed farmers had given â€œaccurate and honest accountsâ€<9d>. â€œI am left in no doubt that all witnesses observed a single, strikingly unusual and unique event in that region at that time,â€<9d> the judge said. In 2012, PTTEPAA was fined $510,000 in the Darwin local court for breaches of the Offshore Petroleum Act. The company has previously said it has spent more than $40m on the clean-up. The company conducted a 2013 environmental monitoring survey that found â€œno oil reached the Indonesian coastâ€<9d>, and that 98.6% of the spilled oil remained within Australian territorial waters. The company was not given permission to survey any Indonesian islands. PTTEPAA sold Montara in 2018. A spokesperson for PTTEPAA says the company â€œremains disappointedâ€<9d> by the federal courtâ€™s decision. The spokesperson says the courtâ€™s judgment related only to Sandaâ€™s claim and that the other 15,482 claimants were â€œstatute-barred and must be determined separatelyâ€<9d>. â€œThe courtâ€™s decision does not negate the requirement for individuals to demonstrate their actual loss and damage,â€<9d> the company says. At a court hearing on 21 December lawyers for the farmers said that to individually determine more than 15,000 claims could take â€œ60 years of full-time judicial attentionâ€<9d>. The companyâ€™s appeal documents argue, among other things, that the original decision wrongly dismissed or placed insufficient weight on evidence from some experts that said it was likely oil from the Montara spill never reached Sandaâ€™s island. The company argues the decision in Sandaâ€™s favour was flawed, and that the judge â€œshould have instead found that Sanda failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that Montara oil reached the coastal areas of Rote and Kupang in a sufficient quantity or concentration to cause damage to seaweed cropsâ€<9d>. Lawyers for the company argued before the court that seaweed crops may have been affected by â€œice-iceâ€<9d> disease, caused by rising sea temperatures and climate change. The judge said he was â€œnot persuadedâ€<9d> there was evidence to support this. â€˜We have to keep goingâ€™ Ben Slade, a managing principal at the law firm Maurice Blackburn, has run the class action since 2016. Slade says the right to exploit natural resources carries with it serious responsibilities, including a duty of care to those affected by careless management of those resources. â€œPTTEPAA was supremely careless. Its management of the Montara well didnâ€™t come within a bullâ€™s roar of competence and the consequence of that failure was that almost fifteen and a half thousand seaweed farmers suffered devastating economic loss. The Australian courts have found they should be compensated for that,â€<9d> he says. â€œThe company has denied responsibility in the Australian courts aggressively and has resisted every step of the way. It has taken years and years of working tirelessly to get this case towards a conclusion, when weâ€™ve been right all along.â€<9d> Emily Mitchell, the research director at Jubilee Australia Research Centre, says tens of thousands more people may have been affected. â€œNo study has ever been funded by PTTEP Australasia in Indonesia into the impacts of the Montara oil disaster,â€<9d> she says. â€œIn East Nusa Tenggara, 12 years after the spill, people still do not have answers about the extent of the damage, let alone how that damage can be fixed. How will the mangroves grow back? How will fish stocks improve? That is completely unacceptable.â€<9d> Mitchell says the transnational nature of the oil spill has complicated the effort to hold the company to account. She says environmental impacts in Prince William Sound, Alaska, were still being felt a quarter of a century after the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill. â€œWe are now at the halfway point of that timeline, yet there has still never been any comprehensive assessment funded by the company to assess the damage in Indonesia,â€<9d> she says. Ferdi Tanoni keeps travelling, keeps talking. He says the company must accept its fault, and that the governments of Australia and Indonesia must â€œhave the courageâ€<9d> to ensure justice is done. â€œPeople keep calling me and I say to them, â€˜keep on praying and we will winâ€™.

JK Rowling co-writes the screenplay with Steve Kloves; Potter veteran David Yates directs with a sure hand; and Eddie Redmayne is looking more eccentric and Dickensian than ever in his role, a Copperfield or even a young Mr Dick with his shock of hair, faintly unfocused gaze, unworldly bowtie and fractionally too-short trousers. The Secrets of Dumbledore is another very amiable and lovely-looking fantasy adventure with some great production design and visual effects, especially in the New York scenes. But itâ€™s not about â€œsecretsâ€<9d> as much as new IP-franchise narrative components shuffled into the ongoing content and shuffled out again. Yet there is certainly something intriguing about the questions arising from the sagaâ€™s approach to the existing Potter timeline. Mads Mikkelsen has been brought into the series to replace the now problematic Johnny Depp in the role of Gellert Grindelwald, the evil wizard who once had a close relationship with Albus Dumbledore himself (played by Jude Law with a twinklingly donnish manner and beard). Mikkelsen gives a subtler and more insidious performance than Deppâ€™s, and the â€œpale eyeâ€<9d> effect is more restrained. The movie takes us into the world of 1930s Europe and Weimar Berlin; Grindelwald happens to be in prison and is planning to gain absolute control of the wizarding world when he gets out, by the accepted democratic route if that is convenient. Remind you of anyone? Newt and Grindelwald have each captured a vitally important fantastic beast that will play a key part in the voting process and now Dumbledore is directing a new crew of good guys to tackle Grindelwaldâ€™s malevolent strategy, as he prepares to grab control of the wizarding world with a mandate to pursue a hateful war against the non-magic peoples. Jacob Kowalski (played by the excellent Dan Fogler) is the muggle â€“ or in American, no-maj â€“ New York baker, still poignantly in love with Queenie Goldstein (Alison Sudol) who has gone over to the Grindelian dark side for reasons still to be teased out. There is also Newtâ€™s coolly patrician brother Theseus (Callum Turner), as competent and unfazed as a John Buchan character, and Professor Lally Hicks, stylishly played by Jessica Williams, provides the intellectual steel, wizard Yusuf Kama (William Nadylam) will further upset the applecart and Newtâ€™s jolly-hockey-sticks assistant Bunty Broadacre (Victoria Yeates) has a bit of a non-serious crush on our hero. And as the contest begins, we shall find out more about the enigmatic Dumbledoreâ€™s personal life and his relationship with the troubled Credence (Ezra Miller). The open secret of Dumbledoreâ€™s gay identity is explored further, along with its subsequent effect on the more homophobic older generation; and his relationship with Grindelwald is established in the opening dialogue scene, albeit with a calm, blank sort of emotional restraint. This central relationship seems to be, if not passionless exactly, then certainly a case of emotional pain and rapture being all in the past. There are some great scenes: I loved the Indiana Jones-ish sequence when Newt has to rescue his brother from a dank and horrible cave guarded by a grisly warder, played by the Austrian actor Peter Simonischek (the legendary Toni Erdmann from Maren Adeâ€™s black comedy) and Newt and Theseus both have to do a silly hip-wiggling dance to mesmerise the horrible creatures that infest the place. By invoking fascism and the approaching world war, the film is gesturing at something overwhelmingly evil, and yet by the end you might find the essentially non-committal storytelling style of franchise film-making, with its suspended resolutions, works against this. Then there is the question of the looming Potter world. We may or may not encounter Harryâ€™s parents soon. We meet famous Hogwarts teachers in their youth, although if we assume that Harry Potter and the Philosopherâ€™s Stone was happening around the end of the 20th century, we might pedantically ponder the fact that this would make key teaching staff at that time around 100 years old. Magic preserves youth, clearly. And what of Grindelwald himself? Is he more or less important and evil than Voldemort? Well, surely Rowling has all this mapped out. Itâ€™s good-natured entertainment, though there is still something weightless and formless about the narrative. â€¢ Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore is released on 7 April in Australia, 8 April in the UK, and 15 April in the US.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

But Iâ€™m still here!â€™ Johnny Knoxville on parties, moral panic and risking it all for Jackass","https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/14/johnny-knoxville-party-years-moral-panic-risking-it-all-jackass-mtv","https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/feb/14/johnny-knoxville-party-years-moral-panic-risking-it-all-jackass-mtv","I hear Johnny Knoxvilleâ€™s Tennessee drawl before I see him. â€œIâ€™m gonna getcha!â€<9d> he barks â€“ part childrenâ€™s entertainer, part axe murderer â€“ as he chases the small child of one of his entourage down the hotel corridor. â€œWhereâ€™s my little honey bunny?â€<9d> His infectious cackle and her giggling shrieks ricochet into the room where I am waiting to meet him. Knoxville has been provoking shock and delight for 22 years, ever since his TV show Jackass first aired on MTV. The formula was beautifully simple: a ragtag group of skateboarders and oddballs with a punk-rock aesthetic filmed themselves undertaking painful, grotesque DIY stunts â€“ no context necessary. Audiences tuned in for the back yard suburban anarchy, but stayed for the gangâ€™s camaraderie. It was absurd and puerile â€“ the New York Times dismissed the film that followed the TV series as â€œa documentary version of Fight Club, shorn of social insight, intellectual pretension and cinematic interestâ€<9d>. Not many would have described Knoxville and co as visionaries when they started hitting each other in the testicles for laughs. But years before YouTube or Twitter, let alone the Kardashians or TikTok, it showed where culture was heading: towards reality TV and would-be celebrities putting themselves in danger for viral footage; towards the constant documenting of our lives for content. Knoxville, 50, was born Philip John Clapp Jr. He grew up in the Tennessee city from which he took his stage name, the third and youngest child of a tyre company boss and a Sunday school teacher. He has often suggested the genesis of his career lies with his prankster father. â€œI grew up idolising him; he was my biggest comedic influence,â€<9d> he says. Philip Sr liked to trick his employees with laxative-spiked milkshakes or fake letters from sexual health clinics. His son was also a target. â€œSometimes he would wake me up by throwing a glass of water in my face,â€<9d> Knoxville recalls, as if that was the most natural thing in the world. â€œIâ€™d wake up and, of course, I would laugh. He would just start telling me jokes â€“ he couldnâ€™t wait for me to be up so he could start telling me jokes!â€<9d> But his fatherâ€™s influence ran deeper than giving him a bug for buffoonery. â€œI grew up always wanting to please people, because my dad drank pretty hard,â€<9d> says Knoxville. â€œAnd when you grow up with an alcoholic father, you want to put out fires and make sure everythingâ€™s OK. Thatâ€™s what you think as a kid, right? That you can help it that way. â€œMaybe I didnâ€™t love myself so much a lot of the time,â€<9d> he suggests. â€œMaybe my self-worth had taken some hits.â€<9d> Knoxvilleâ€™s body has taken plenty of hits, too. The â€œcomedic masochistâ€<9d>, as he calls himself, has been hit by a riot-control mine, knocked unconscious by a heavyweight boxer and mauled by bulls on multiple occasions. He has suffered breakages, concussions, vertigo and a ripped penis, from his attempts to backflip a motorcycle. It has all been in pursuit of â€œgood footageâ€<9d>. His career is one of the purest expressions of â€œno pain, no gloryâ€<9d>. But his sense of humour has remained intact throughout. He rarely stops laughing, often breaking into a smile that consumes his face, his eyes turning to slits behind thick, black-rimmed glasses. Knoxville created Jackass with two longtime collaborators, the film directors/producers Spike Jonze and Jeff Tremaine, but of the trio only he did stunts. â€œIt just naturally happened,â€<9d> he says. â€œI have a big personality and sometimes I have to reel myself in. Thatâ€™s something that, in therapy, I realised: like, wow, I can be a lot! So just have some cocoa and settle down.â€<9d> He has been in therapy since 2006. Although he admits he â€œprobably got addicted to doing larger stuntsâ€<9d>, he has so far resisted delving into that side of his psyche. â€œThereâ€™s other stuff that needs work,â€<9d> he says. â€œIâ€™m like: â€˜Fix everything else. Letâ€™s not mess with the side of me that does stunts, because I donâ€™t want to know.â€™â€<9d> We are talking before the launch of Jackass Forever, the fourth of the films that grew out of the initial TV series. He was in his late 40s when it was filmed and you can see the mileage creeping in â€“ the blows hit harder, recovery takes longer. But, judging by early box office results, audiences are not bothered. Even the critics have finally caught up, with GQ asserting that Jackass operates â€œat the intersection of a number of ancient American traditionsâ€<9d>, with â€œtraces of Buster Keaton and the Three Stoogesâ€<9d>. The New Yorker has saluted its â€œjoyous vision of resilience in the face of obvious traumasâ€<9d>. â€œSome things make us laugh when we read them, you know, when it gets too highbrow,â€<9d> says Knoxville. â€œBut who doesnâ€™t like being compared to Buster Keaton? Heâ€™s a legend. And heâ€™s as funny today as he was back then. Someone running and falling down is timeless. Itâ€™s just funny. Thank God, or I would have no career.â€<9d> Jackass Forever very nearly wasnâ€™t funny. In one stunt, in which Knoxville stood in front of a charging bull, he was flipped, spinning into the air before landing on his head. He sustained a broken wrist, broken ribs and a concussion that left him with brain damage. It took him months to recover, including a course of antidepressants. Did that brush with death change his perspective? â€œNo,â€<9d> he says, after a long pause. â€œI knew going into this film that this will be the last time Iâ€™m gonna be doing big stunts. I didnâ€™t know I was going to get as injured as I did, but I brought that on myself. I have nothing to complain about, only things to be grateful for.â€<9d> His father died in hospital just before filming began on Jackass Forever. â€œHe was my hero,â€<9d> says Knoxville. â€œIn the back of my mind, I was like: â€˜God, I wanted to tell him we were making another film, because that would have made him so happy and lifted his spirits.â€™ But I didnâ€™t get to do that.â€<9d> Despite his fatherâ€™s drinking, Knoxville had a happy childhood and did well at school â€“ for a while. â€œAs soon as I hit puberty, I cast my protractor aside,â€<9d> he says, with another of those big smiles. â€œI was no longer interested in school, because I didnâ€™t feel like it was going to be very useful to me.â€<9d> He set his heart on showbiz, moving to Los Angeles at 18. â€œI wanted to be remembered,â€<9d> he says. â€œI wasnâ€™t making much money at all. Iâ€™m sure I was struggling, but I didnâ€™t really look at it like that, because I was young and pursuing something I believed in.â€<9d> Plus, he adds: â€œI was young and in Los Angeles! It was so much fun that I took my eye off the ball for a number of years. I was more interested in going out and partying. It wasnâ€™t until my then girlfriend, who became my first wife, got pregnant and we had a daughter on the way that I was like: â€˜OK, I really have to figure out what Iâ€™m going to do to support this child.â€™ Thatâ€™s what really kicked everything into high gear.â€<9d> He started writing for Big Brother, a southern California skateboard-and-culture magazine, where Tremaine was the editor and Jonze a photographer. He acted in TV commercials, with little concern about compromising artistic integrity. â€œOh, are you kidding? I was fucking thrilled!â€<9d> he says. â€œYou work for a day and then you get residuals. When Jackass got on TV, there were a handful of people who were like: â€˜Oh, he sold out.â€™ Iâ€™m like: â€˜Fuck you! I sold out years ago.â€™ I was advertising Dentyne Ice gum, Taco Bell, whatever I could do to support my family.â€<9d> One day, he pitched Big Brother a story in which he would test selfâ€‘defence equipment on himself (pepper spray, stun guns and so on). Tremaine suggested he film it. The resulting video was widely circulated on VHS, like a sort of analogue viral video. Before long, they were making Jackass for MTV. The outrage at the resulting show was inevitable. There was disgust at its aggressively lewd, low-brow larks â€“ and alarm that others would imitate them. The moral panic was fuelled by the Connecticut senator Joe Lieberman, who said: â€œThere are some things that are so potentially dangerous and inciting, particularly to vulnerable children, that they should not be put on TV.â€<9d> â€œI didnâ€™t really care about the moral outrage,â€<9d> says Knoxville. â€œBut I didnâ€™t like when we would have copycat incidents and kids would get hurt.â€<9d> The public outcry forced MTVâ€™s hand; lawyers and health-and-safety officials got involved. Defanged and demotivated (â€œThey said you canâ€™t jump off anything higher than 4ft!â€<9d>), Knoxville quit â€“ to make movies exactly the way he wanted to. The franchise that began in 2002 with Jackass: The Movie has since spawned spin-off films such as Bad Grandpa, more TV shows, a video game and countless imitators. â€œI went from no one knowing my name, working in a restaurant, waiting tables, to the cover of Rolling Stone, which is a big jump from a small town in east Tennessee,â€<9d> says Knoxville. â€œIt took a while for me to get my feet under me.â€<9d> Numerous Jackass cast members have spoken about their battles with drug and alcohol addiction, most notably Stephen Glover (Steve-O), who spent time in a psychiatric hospital (he is now sober). Knoxville doesnâ€™t think you can blame his creation. â€œEveryone was doing that, quite honestly, before we started,â€<9d> he says. â€œI guess you get a certain personality that does what we do, that lives hard and laughs hard. But weâ€™re never loaded during shooting. If someoneâ€™s drinking, they canâ€™t do stunts.â€<9d> Jackass Forever was the first film without Ryan Dunn, one of the original cast members, who died in a drink-driving accident in 2011. â€œIt was crushing to have that spirit extinguished,â€<9d> Knoxville says. â€œItâ€™s something that we all are still dealing with and will be dealing with the rest of our lives. We all lost a brother.â€<9d> For a while, he wasnâ€™t sure he should make another film without Dunn. â€œBut we all felt we still had something to say.â€<9d> Does Knoxville worry about dying? â€œI have fear, but I have a way to manage it. Iâ€™ve almost died a few times making Jackass over the years. But Iâ€™m still here,â€<9d> he says, knocking the wooden table between us. No nightmares about former stunts? No bulls hurtling toward him in his sleep? â€œNo, the opposite. I laugh in my sleep. I just cackle,â€<9d> he says. â€œMy wife hears it. So, yeah, I go to bed feeling pretty good.â€<9d> What does scare him, then? â€œSomething happening to my children, my family,â€<9d> he replies, earnestly. â€œIâ€™m a father first, right? And I worry about them. That scares me.â€<9d> Knoxville lives with his second wife, Naomi, and their two young children, Rocko and Arlo (he also has a grownup daughter, Madison, by his first wife). He had tried to keep the younger kids blissfully unaware of his career â€“ but then sixâ€‘year-old Rocko found out about the show from school friends. â€œI said: â€˜Yeah, Dad has a silly show where he does pranks and stunts, but itâ€™s not really appropriate for you to see.â€™ Especially for him, because heâ€™s wired like my father. He has that rambunctious spirit and Iâ€™m afraid that he would want to do it. And thatâ€™s just not going to be on the cards.â€<9d> Does Knoxville ever think he is being selfish by putting his life on the line? Does he worry about how his wife and children might be affected? It is not as if Jackass is his only career option. As well as running Dickhouse Productions with Tremaine and Jonze, he has had acting roles in The Dukes of Hazzard, The Ringer and Men in Black II. He will soon be filming a new show for Hulu â€“ a Steve Levitan project called Reboot. Then there is Big Ass Happy Family Jubilee, the radio show he does with his cousin, the singer-songwriter Roger Alan Wade. â€œThereâ€™s risk,â€<9d> Knoxville admits. The stunts â€œupset everyone. During filming, theyâ€™re worried â€“ and for good reason. But, at the end of the day, this is what I do. And thereâ€™s a lot of people who have jobs that are dangerous. Can you imagine how a policemanâ€™s wife feels? Or a firemanâ€™s? Iâ€™m just a halfâ€‘assed stuntman.â€<9d> Jackass Forever is in cinemas now",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

I need to be very careful where I tread: they are emerging from under tree roots and decaying leaves, crossing my path as they leave the wood, returning to their ancestral breeding pond. Next morning, more arrive, clambering over tussocky grass, and even my boot, determined to reach the water: the unstoppable march of the toads, which often ends in tragedy if reaching their goal entails crossing a busy road. Today, the only hazards are my feet and an occasional farm vehicle. Thomas Pennant, the 18th-century Welsh naturalist, called toads â€œthe most deformed and hideous of all animalsâ€<9d>, his opinion likely swayed by their warty, toxic skins, down-in-the-mouth countenance and by centuries of associating them with witchcraft. But holding one, itâ€™s hard not to be mesmerised by the beauty of those amber eyes or moved by their primeval breeding instinct. I lowered the struggling amphibian back into the grass, then watched as he plopped into the water. Cumbersome crawling gave way to buoyant breaststroke, propelled by powerful kicks of spade-footed hind legs. Then he floated, mid-pond, taking stock of his surroundings, until ripples spreading from a passing female caught his attention. He set off in pursuit: no luck, she batted him away with a powerful kick. There were plenty more in this pond, many hard to spot on the muddy bottom, others swimming in search of a mate. Some had already paired; large females piggy-backing males that gripped them in amplexus, the mating embrace that only ends when she has wound long strings of eggs around water weeds and he has doused them with his sperm. In a few days this annual toad orgy will be over. Theyâ€™ll return to a crepuscular existence, only leaving their hiding places to feed after sunset, seldom seen in daylight except in accidental encounters. Itâ€™s reassuring to know that they are still here in such numbers, after all these years. â€¢ Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

The Security Service was â€œstruggling to copeâ€<9d> with an increased workload, and the team responsible for the north-west of England had declared an â€œamberâ€<9d> period of stress and high capacity the month before the attack in 2017. The information, revealed on Tuesday, came from the testimony of four MI5 witnesses and 10 officers from north west counter-terrorism police, who gave evidence in closed sessions last year after the chair of the Manchester arena inquiry, Sir John Saunders, ruled it could compromise national security if it were heard in public. Families of those killed in the attack have said they are shocked and appalled and found the admission from one MI5 officer that he had raised concerns with superiors and worried something could â€œget throughâ€<9d> because of the high volume of documents â€œdifficult to swallowâ€<9d>. Summarising the evidence heard in secret over 10 days, Paul Greaney QC, counsel for the inquiry, said the MI5 officer who first assessed one piece of intelligence accepted during questioning that it could be understood, at the time, to indicate â€œactivity of pressing national security concernâ€<9d>. Two pieces of intelligence received by MI5 in the months leading up to the attack were not passed to counter-terrorism police and the security services did not fully appreciate their significance. Had the significance of the intelligence been understood, two witnesses agreed further investigative steps may have been taken. Witnesses from counter-terrorism police and MI5 described IT systems for sharing information between them as â€œclunkyâ€<9d> and â€œhit and missâ€<9d> and the â€œsystem for triaging unsolicited intelligence was admitted to be a bit haphazardâ€<9d>. That system has now changed. A senior MI5 witness gave evidence that large electronic files would occasionally not send properly, so that PowerPoint presentations had to be sent slide by slide. Occasionally documents would be sent to police but it might not be realised for a day that they had not arrived. MI5 did not tell police that the agency had information that Abedi had travelled from Istanbul to Libya in May 2016, despite an intention to do so. One witness described the role of an MI5 investigator as being â€œlike a spider in the centre of a web, with strands of intelligence from many sources coming together for them to assessâ€<9d>, while another said that the team in MI5 responsible for the north west was surprised by the pace of the change in workload after the declaration of a â€œcaliphateâ€<9d> by Islamic State in 2014. The north west investigative team went into â€œamberâ€<9d> on its workload dashboard in April 2017, some of its casework was suspended that month and into May â€“ the month of the attack. By the time Salman Abedi had murdered 22 people and injured hundreds more when he detonated a suicide vest at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017, he was a closed â€œsubject of interestâ€<9d> after being red-flagged by the security services twice in 2014 and 2015. He first came on their radar in 2010, just before his 16th birthday. MI5 had intelligence that Abedi supported Islamic State, but one witness said there were a large number of people during this period who expressed such support who â€œdid not pose a threat to UK national securityâ€<9d>. Saunders said he understood the evidence had raised â€œquestions that may not have been raised beforeâ€<9d>, and that would inform his conclusions, but were not a finding of fact. Kim Harrison, of Slater and Gordon, solicitor for families of 12 of the victims, said they were â€œdeeply shocked and appalled by the evidence read today that the MI5 north west investigative team were struggling to cope with a significant increase and change in workload from 2015â€<9d>. â€œTo hear that concerns had apparently been raised with superiors regarding the triaging of intelligence, including worries that something could get through due to the volumes of documents being considered is difficult to swallow,â€<9d> she said.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

But then â€œtheyâ€<9d> never had to cope with derisive reviews, tumbling box office receipts and the highly public fall from grace of an A-list star. In the ranks of movies based on the works of JK Rowling, Fantastic Beasts 2: The Crimes of Grindelwald, released in 2018, was the Wizarding World equivalent of that time Neville Longbottom accidentally transplanted his own ears on to a cactus; an episode so muddled and painful that the average Hogwarts student would need a magic spell just to understand what the hell was supposed to be going on and why any of us should care. And so the sagaâ€™s next instalment, The Secrets of Dumbledore, is probably best off harking back to the good old days, when Harry, Ron and Hermione only had to worry about Voldemortâ€™s next appearance rather than the potential cancellation of an entire movie series. Duly, the new trailer for the film arrived this week, and once again weâ€™re heading back to the famous wizarding school. Crimes of Grindelwald also featured some scenes set at Hogwarts, but it looks like this time around the grand old place could play an even bigger part in the action. Thereâ€™s even a clip of Michael Gambon as Professor Albus Dumbledore, just to remind everyone that this was a very successful movie series once. The problem is, even if Hogwarts is back in the picture, we all know this isnâ€™t going to be a movie about quidditch, inter-house rivalries and the difficulties of navigating Platform 9 3/4 at Kingâ€™s Cross station. Itâ€™s going to be a film about Eddie Redmayneâ€™s Newt Scamander and his ever-expanding menagerie of magical creatures. Itâ€™s going to be about Jude Lawâ€™s Dumbledore battling Mads Mikkelsenâ€™s Grindelwald, even though they once signed a blood pact promising never to fight each other. Itâ€™s going to be a film in which we all ask ourselves over and again why Rowling had to borrow a plot line from the Star Wars prequels and make lovable Queenie turn to the dark side in her desperate attempts to retain her romance with Jacob Kowalski. (By the way, where is Queenieâ€™s sister and Newtâ€™s future wife, Tina?) But most of all itâ€™s going to be about the true identity of Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller), which will most likely (if the filmâ€™s title is to be believed) have something to do with something naughty Dumbledore did back in his tangled youth. This is the same Credence Barebone whom we were first introduced to as the moping son of an American anti-witchcraft campaigner in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016), but who was revealed by the end of the film to be something called an Obscurial, a wizard who ignores their own magical potential due to psychological torment. In Crimes of Grindelwald we were told Credence was in fact the long lost brother of ZoÃ« Kravitzâ€™s Leta Lestrange, Corvus Lestrange V (no, us neither). But by the end of that movie he probably wasnâ€™t actually this either. According to Grindelwald (once played by Colin Farrell, then Johnny Depp, now Mikkelsen), he was actually Aurelius Dumbledore, Albusâ€™s long-lost brother. But why should we trust anyone who has swapped faces more times than Doctor Who? The truth of Credenceâ€™s identity seems almost as befuddled as the apparently ever-shifting allegiances of Alan Rickmanâ€™s Professor Snape in the original Harry Potter books and movies, except a whole lot less interesting. The main issue here is that the Fantastic Beasts movies are prequels to the events of young Harryâ€™s schooldays, and if Credenceâ€™s true identity were that of anyone crucial to Potter fandom, somebody would have worked it out by now. So why is Rowling so obsessed with Credence Barebone? Miller is doing an excellent job, but Credence has been through more tonal costume changes than Ron once went through shonky Christmas jumpers. Letâ€™s hope the actor knows where itâ€™s going to end up, and why it all matters. And letâ€™s hope the rest of us find out before we lose the will to live and take a (figurative) dive-bomb off Hogwartsâ€™ tallest tower. â€¢ This article was amended on 4 March and 9 March 2022.

The Â£30m Shakespeare North Playhouse in Prescot, Knowsley, has a 470-seat theatre, the Cockpit, modelled on Inigo Jonesâ€™s cockpit-in-court design in 17th-century London. The site also has an outdoor performance garden, funded by Liverpudlian comedian Ken Doddâ€™s charitable foundation, and a small studio theatre, as well as exhibition and educational facilities. A weekend of free activities will commence on 15 July with an event created with Slung Low theatre company entitled All the Joy That You Can Wish, which will feature the players of supporter-owned local football team Prescot Cables as well as the builders from the Kier group who are putting the finishing touches to the venue. Onlookers will be invited to gather at the new Prospero Place outside the theatre and join in a ceremony to â€œsummon the musesâ€<9d> to Knowsley, which is also the Liverpool City Region Borough of Culture for 2022. The weekend continues with performances curated by Prescot-born playwright and actor Ashleigh Nugent. Local heroes will appear on the Cockpit stage too, with screenwriter Jimmy McGovern and comedian Johnny Vegas performing solo shows later in the month. Vegas said the new theatre was both stunning and intimate: â€œIt doesnâ€™t feel like thereâ€™s a cheap seat in the house and thatâ€™s beautiful. You walk in there and you feel like weâ€™ve taken culture back. Culture, art, creativity, theatre, everything is for all of us and thatâ€™s what that space does, it reminds us of that.â€<9d> The site is anticipated to attract 140,000 visitors a year and Vegas said that it would be â€œmonumentalâ€<9d> for the region. Max Steinberg, chair of the Shakespeare North Trust, told the Guardian last summer that bars and restaurants, many of them Shakespeare-themed, were already springing up nearby. â€œThis is not Field of Dreams, a case of build it and they will come,â€<9d> said Steinberg. â€œWe are building and they have already come.â€<9d> In September, the playhouse will stage work by three young winners of a nationwide playwriting competition. It will then put on its first Shakespeare production, A Midsummer Nightâ€™s Dream, co-produced with Newcastleâ€™s Northern Stage and the company Not Too Tame which is run by Warrington-born Jimmy Fairhurst, a rugby Super League player turned actor. This version of Shakespeareâ€™s fantastical comedy explores class struggle and draws on the raucous energy of teenagers on a night out. The play has a local connection too: it has been claimed that it was written for the marriage of William Stanley, sixth earl of Derby (whose family seat is Knowsley Hall), and Elizabeth de Vere. Laura Collier, creative director at the venue, said the opening season was â€œa statement of intent in terms of our ambition for the venue and our engagement with the local community and audiences in the years aheadâ€<9d>. Shakespeare North Playhouse has been built during the pandemic with public funds and donations, including Â£12.2m from Knowsley council, Â£10.5m from the Liverpool city region combined authority and Â£3m from the governmentâ€™s Covid-19 culture recovery fund.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

When the electricity meter ran out he would play for hours unamplified in complete darkness. McGeoch was a Scottish fine art student and when his flatmate Malcolm Garrett (who would design artwork for Buzzcocks, Duran Duran and Simple Minds) told Howard Devoto, whoâ€™d recently quit punk pioneers Buzzcocks, that McGeoch could play all the parts of Televisionâ€™s Marquee Moon, Devoto was impressed. â€œThat made me think he would be somebody worth knowing,â€<9d> he recalls in The Light Pours Out of Me, a new biography on McGeoch by Rory Sullivan-Burke. The pair connected and this materialised into Magazine and their revelatory debut single Shot By Both Sides. Despite the riff being a hand-me-down from Buzzcocks, McGeochâ€™s playing on it â€“ as urgent and taut as it was fluid and melodic â€“ quickly grabbed people. Siouxsie Sioux recalled: â€œeveryone was saying: â€˜who is playing guitar in Magazine?â€™â€<9d> It captivated a teenage Johnny Marr. â€œShot By Both Sides was so arresting,â€<9d> he tells me. â€œThe sound and attitude was very modern â€“ it sounded like it had an agenda.â€<9d> The track was a line in the sand for Marr. â€œPunk wasnâ€™t the letter A in a new alphabet, it was Z in the old lexicon and then after was a clean slate.â€<9d> McGeoch was operating at an elevated level for the times, according to Marr. â€œHe took that artistic big bang [punk] into something so much more than just barre chord thrash,â€<9d> he says. â€œHe wasnâ€™t pretending to be in some crap spitting punk band. He wasnâ€™t joining in the dumbing down brigade. His intention was to be modern and you hear that in the very deliberate choice of using the flanger on everything.â€<9d> The flanger â€“ normally a foot pedal, used to bend the notes of a guitar â€“ was customised by McGeoch. He adapted it to be attached to a mic stand and controlled by hand, allowing greater control and resulting in a ringing, icy sound that had both cinematic scope and a fierce crunch. â€œJohnâ€™s playing was a deliberate modernism,â€<9d> says Marr. â€œThe flanger modulates the signal so that it wobbles, and the effect is psychedelic. Not â€˜oh so trippy 60s manâ€™ or Hendrix, but psychedelic like youâ€™ve taken bad acid or been psychotic after three days of speed.â€<9d> Across three albums â€“ Real Life, Secondhand Daylight and The Correct Use of Soap â€“ McGeochâ€™s playing was an electric presence. â€œI had the fortune to watch him execute his talent in the most incredibly dexterous way,â€<9d> recalls Magazineâ€™s Barry Adamson. â€œHe seemed to be able to take on anything that came to his mind. I didnâ€™t see him struggle.â€<9d> McGeoch was a versatile player, gliding between sparkling arpeggios, ripping riffs, or simply adding subtle colour, balancing deftness and potency. â€œJohnâ€™s playing helped shape the new wave musical landscape by finding a new place for guitar,â€<9d> says James Dean Bradfield of the Manic Street Preachers. â€œIts place became less vainglorious, less heroic perhaps, but still strident, articulate and aggressive when it needed to be.â€<9d> The Correct Use of Soap was deemed a masterpiece by many, including Marr. It obsessed a 10-year-old Jonny Greenwood who played it on repeat and took notes, but McGeoch was frustrated by the bandâ€™s lack of commercial success. McGeoch, Adamson and Magazine keyboard player Dave Formula were poached to play in Visage, who quickly had huge success, providing McGeoch with financial stability as well as a taste for fine wine. But there was another band who wanted him: Siouxsie and the Banshees. They had just lost their guitarist and drummer and while still with Magazine he was invited to play on Happy House, immediately making an impact with a shimmering guitar line that snakes through the song. He was eventually convinced to make the switch permanent in 1980. â€œThe Banshees were his mistress and eventually we got him to leave his wife,â€<9d> Steven Severin of the band says. â€œIt was like getting George Best on guitar,â€<9d> says Marr. â€œThere was a huge gaping hole [in Magazine] as soon as he left,â€<9d> says Adamson. â€œIt changed the course of the band forever and helped it to its place of ultimate derailment.â€<9d> Magazine were over a year later. The albums Kaleidoscope, Juju and A Kiss in the Dreamhouse marked a hugely fertile period for the Banshees with McGeoch-powered tracks such as Spellbound invoking â€œpure invention, grace and bloodlust balletâ€<9d> according to Bradfield. Marr adds: â€œThe music he made with the Banshees â€¦ the word imperial was made for that music.â€<9d> However, despite the creative peaks, McGeochâ€™s thirst for booze â€“ which was already plentiful â€“ was increasing, and cocaine was thrown into the mix. Things imploded in 1982 in Madrid when McGeoch was in such bad shape he was playing the wrong songs on stage. â€œIt became obvious that he didnâ€™t know where he was,â€<9d> Banshees drummer Budgie later said. â€œI thought heâ€™d just gone too far that night, but much later he admitted that heâ€™d been given a Valium to calm his nerves, cos he was shaking either from withdrawal or too much drinking. If weâ€™d been noticing this we might have said the show canâ€™t go on. But we werenâ€™t.â€<9d> McGeoch ended up in addiction clinic the Priory but was fired by the band after they visited him and instead of being in hospital heâ€™d gone to the pub with the day release patients. â€œIt sounds very callous,â€<9d> Sioux has said of the move. â€œI wish it hadnâ€™t happened. But alcoholism is not something that gets fixed overnight.â€<9d> Severin reflects on the decision: â€œ40 years ago the term rehab was not used yet; there were no support systems available, especially in the music industry. For all we knew John was effectively committed to an asylum until further notice.â€<9d> McGeoch then joined the Armoury Show with ex-Magazine drummer John Doyle and ex-Skids members Richard Jobson and Russell Webb. However, yet another iconic post-punk band wanted him: Public Image Ltd. He lasted six years but it wasnâ€™t an auspicious start. Early on his first tour in Austria a rowdy crowd, still acting out the cartoon version of punk, were spitting and throwing things. McGeoch confronted them and in return got a 1.5 litre wine bottle â€“ stolen from PiLâ€™s dressing room â€“ launched into his face. This resulted in laser surgery and 44 stitches; bandmates think he lost about a pint of blood before he could even get off stage. It wasnâ€™t the first time McGeoch had intervened in the audienceâ€™s idiotic parroting of punkâ€™s heyday, once climbing into the crowd at a Banshees show to rip off a Nazi armband. The wine bottle incident rocked him, though, and people noticed a distinct change in him. PiL came to an end when Lydon accepted a solo deal. McGeoch was a martial arts expert and when he was told by the bandâ€™s manager there was no new album deal and PiL was effectively over, he later told a friend that he contemplated taking him out to the pub car park and killing him. Instead, he walked away. He tried to get a band off the ground with Heaven 17â€™s Glenn Gregory but it never happened and he retreated from music, focused on family life and trained as a nurse. He returned to music later on, writing theme tunes for Channel 5, but at just 48 he died of Sudep (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy). Alcohol had remained a major problem but he was sober in the final months of his life. â€œJohnâ€™s approach to playing helped define an entire genre of music that came after punk,â€<9d> says his biographer Sullivan-Burke. The simplicity of his playing, combined with a technical ability that never veered into needless virtuosity, inspired many from 1990s American grunge and alt-rock to British pop. â€œHe chose very simple lines over anything bombastic,â€<9d> Roddy Frame of Aztec Camera once said. â€œHe was kind of a guitar antihero, the song came first and he tried to complement that.â€<9d> Steve Albini emulated some of his playing in his pulverising noise rock band Big Black. â€œHe was an innovator with the pure sound of his guitar,â€<9d> he tells me. â€œI admire the economy of his playing. He made very precise choices that were usually beautifully simple.â€<9d> He also shaped one of the Manic Street Preachersâ€™ most beloved records. â€œJohn was a massive influence on The Holy Bible,â€<9d> says Bradfield. â€œBeing a fan of Magazine and the Banshees prepared me so well for that album without really realising it at the time.â€<9d> After his death Sioux reflected on his talent and impact in the Banshees. â€œJohn McGeoch was my favourite guitarist of all time,â€<9d> she said. â€œHe was into sound in an almost abstract way. I loved the fact that I could say, â€˜I want this to sound like a horse falling off a cliffâ€™, and he would know exactly what I meant. He was easily, without a shadow of a doubt, the most creative guitarist the Banshees ever had.â€<9d> â€¢ The Light Pours Out of Me by Rory Sullivan-Burke is out now, published by Omnibus Press",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

Labourâ€™s Dan Jarvis and the former Conservative minister Johnny Mercer criticised the government for removing the Â£2,389 immigration bill only for long-serving veterans. The Ministry of Defence and the Home Office had planned to announce the fee waiver, which would have applied to Nepali, Fijian and other Commonwealth veterans who had served six years or more on Wednesday. But by excluding partners and dependents, the MPs said on Tuesday night it would still leave veterans facing thousands of pounds of Home Office bills to resolve their familyâ€™s immigration status when they are discharged from service. â€œWe remain concerned that families continue to be sidelined â€“ this amounts to a 25% discount on a Â£10,000 visa fee bill for a family of four,â€<9d> the two MPs said. â€œIt is deeply unjust for the government to profit from them exercising their right to remain in the country for which they risked their lives.â€<9d> The two MPs, both veterans, went public the night before the announcement, arguing that people who had a â€œlong and proud historyâ€<9d> of serving in the British armed forces would still be poorly treated. Britain has long used foreign-born soldiers in its armed forces. Nearly 7% of troops come from outside the UK, most notably Nepali Gurkhas and Fijians, who have served in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Veterans who served a minimum period had the right to UK citizenship, but bureaucratic errors, poor advice and increased feeshave left some as illegal immigrants in the country for which they once served. One, Taitusi Ratacaucau, was told he needed to pay more than Â£50,000 to cover NHS hospital bills after an emergency operation to remove a brain tumour in 2020 because he was no longer considered a British citizen. Ratacaucau and seven others tried and failed to win a legal battle to have their visa fees waived â€“ but were eventually granted leave to remain in the UK last year by the Home Office after a high profile campaign. The campaign group Citizenship4Soldiers said they also wanted ministers to ensure the fee waiver would be backdated, estimating that there are 600 Fijian veterans who could benefit. The group also said it was concerned that â€œfamilies have been excludedâ€<9d>. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary said he was â€œdelighted to announceâ€<9d> that serving personnel and veterans who have served for six years or more â€œwill no longer have to pay the visa feeâ€<9d>. The move was an â€œimportant step to express our sincere gratitudeâ€<9d>, the minister added.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Monkfish from the North Sea and the west of Scotland, where populations have declined to their lowest since 2013, have also joined the guideâ€™s list of â€œfish to avoidâ€<9d>, alongside most skates and rays. Skates and rays are in decline globally, with a third of species facing extinction due to overfishing. The charity said its latest assessment of UK seafood shows a need for more rigorous management of British seas, as well as revealing a glaring data gap of fish and seafood stocks in Scottish waters. Fourteen species of fish and seafood have joined the MCSâ€™s â€œfish to avoidâ€<9d> list. Ten were added last year. The MCS said the picture was concerning as it â€œwas moving in the wrong directionâ€<9d>. â€œThe latest Good Fish Guide ratings â€“ where all new UK ratings are either amber or red rated â€“ illustrate the urgent need for transparency and better management if weâ€™re to recover fish stocks in UK seas,â€<9d> said Clara Johnston, fisheries policy manager at the MCS. Crab and lobster populations are suffering as a result of poor management generally. In the west of Scotland, however, there is particular concern that migrating whales are getting entangled in ropes attached to crab and lobster pots more frequently. A study last year by Nature Scotland found increasing entanglements of cetaceans, sharks and turtles in crab and lobster creels. Reported entanglements were most likely to be minke whales or basking sharks, but 95% of entanglements went unreported, the study said. The waters around Skye were the riskiest for interactions between creels fleets and whales. Charlotte Coombes, MCSâ€™s good fish guide manager, explained: â€œThe migrating whales are funnelled between the mainland and the islands. Some of the evidence suggest the minke whales are not as strong swimmers as humpbacks, so minkes are more affected.â€<9d> Recent data suggest that 2.2% of the local minke population may be killed through entanglement each year. Except for in Shetland, there are no limits to the number of pots that fishers can put in the water in Scotland. The decline in monkfish in the North Sea and the west of Scotland is also worrying, added Coombes. â€œThere are catch limits and that does help. But the limits apply to a wider area, so there is room for the population to be taken at higher quantities than it can sustain.â€<9d> Nine types of Scottish brown crab and lobster were classified differently in this yearâ€™s guide: eight were either â€œfish to avoidâ€<9d> (or amber, under the MCSâ€™s traffic light system), while only one, Shetland brown crab, was rated as â€œbest choiceâ€<9d> (a green traffic light). There was some good news: 10 types of fish and shellfish were now in the â€œbest choiceâ€<9d> category, including sardines from off south-west England and North Sea herring. There are 656 species ratings in all, with 161 now listed as â€œavoidâ€<9d> and 148 as â€œbest choiceâ€<9d>. The Future Fisheries Alliance, a coalition between the MCS, WWF and the RSPB, is calling for fisheries management to be to strengthened. It wants to see the current draft of the Joint Fisheries Statement, due to be published at the end of the year, include targets for recovery of depleted fish populations via more effective management, a commitment to install remote electronic monitoring on vessels and urgent action to tackle wildlife bycatch. Fish to avoid (according to MCS) Monkfish from the North Sea and west of Scotland. Numbers have declined from a peak in 2017 to the lowest since 2013 (below the average for the last 16 years). Management is poor and fishing pressure is too high. If you are desperate for monkfish, those caught in the Celtic Sea remain amber-rated as an â€œOK choiceâ€<9d>. Celtic Sea cod. Cod, whiting and haddock fished here are caught together because they swim and feed together. However, Celtic cod and whiting populations are at dangerously low levels, affecting reproduction rates as a result. Scientists recommend that cod should not be caught at all in this area. Most brown crab and lobster. New ratings for Scottish brown crab and lobster have been added to the Good Fish Guide this year. Eight of the nine new ratings are either rated as amber, or fish to avoid. Shetland brown crab is the only â€œbest choiceâ€<9d>, green-rated option in the UK. Crab and lobster populations are suffering as a result of poor management, and in some areas, there are concerns of entanglement of whales in the ropes attached to pots. There is hope that if the fishing method is improved, it could become sustainable because it makes little difference to the seabed. Best choice Mackerel. Stocks have stayed high, so the green rating remains for this. Scampi and langoustine. These are ranked amber if trawled, but green if pot-caught. North Sea herring. Green again, because the steep decline in population observed since 2017 has slowed down, and an updated stock assessment shows better numbers than previously thought. Sardines from the southern Celtic Sea and Channel. These have been moved from amber to green. King and queen scallops from the Isle of Man. Showing improvements thanks to good management. Queen scallops have been moved off the red list and are now rated amber. Helena Horton",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

In truth: more fearful about their safety, more anxious about their economic futures and wondering if the monumental gains made in gender equality over the last decades are at risk. But they are also louder and more determined than ever. It is impossible to reflect on the last 12 months without focusing on the seismic revolution of understanding of male violence against women and girls (VAWG). Research from Rosa, a grant-making charity for frontline womenâ€™s organisations, reveals that 89% of the 320 organisations they surveyed think public understanding of the problem has transformed since the murder of Sarah Everard one year ago. The past year has also seen a rupturing of the trust between women and the state agencies that pledge to protect them. At a vigil to honour Everard in Clapham Common, which police had tried and failed to prevent by threatening to heavily fine organisers, women who had come to mourn were instead forcibly removed. What trust was left took a further blow with the prosecution of two officers who shared pictures of the murdered sisters Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, the exposure of vile sexist and racist Whatapp messages shared between officers based at Londonâ€™s Charing Cross police station, and ongoing reports of officers accused of domestic abuse going unpunished, or worse uninvestigated. Speaking to the Guardian on Monday, the new national police lead on VAWG, Maggie Blyth, promised change â€“ a prioritisation of crimes against women and a crackdown on men within the ranks of the police who abuse their power. There is a moment of opportunity, she insisted, and it is too important to waste. There is hope. At the grassroots level, councils like Greenwich, where Sabina Nessa was murdered, are helping fund plays about sexism and toxic masculinity, local youth rugby clubs are asking how they can help prevent violence against women, an outpouring of grief after the murder of Everard raised more than half a million pounds that will be distributed to small charities working at the vanguard of tackling misogyny and male violence. On the national stage, the UK government and the mayors of London and Manchester have launched a communications campaign focusing on stopping perpetrators of sexual harassment and violence. The government, the National Police Chiefsâ€™ Council and the College of Policing have agreed to implement all the recommendations made by a damning inspection by the policing watchdog, leading to Blythâ€™s appointment and the upgrading of VAWG to the same strategic footing as terrorism. The challenge now will be keeping the issue in the spotlight as the horror at what happened to Everard â€“ exposed in the trial of her killer Wayne Couzens â€“ moves further into the past. More than a 125 women have died since International Womenâ€™s Day last year, according to the Femicide Census, which notes that a woman is killed by a man every three days. The work of ending menâ€™s violence towards women and girls will be arduous and painstaking. It is â€“ as many who have worked in the sector for decades can attest â€“ the work of a lifetime. But, for now at least, the wail of anger and anguish that crescendoed after the murder of Everard continues to echo through society. Women have found their voice, and they are determined to be heard.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Vladimir Chernukhin, 53, husband of the Tory donor Lubov Chernukhin, used his position in the Russian elite to cultivate influential business contacts while investing in private ventures, according to court documents. Chernukhin, who served as deputy finance minister early in Vladimir Putinâ€™s first presidency, transferred assets to the west after falling out of favour with the Russian regime. Chernukhinâ€™s wife, Lubov, 49, has donated nearly Â£2.2m to the Conservative party. Labour has called on the Tories to donate any Russian-linked political donations to Ukrainian humanitarian causes. A 78-page witness statement, written by Russian-born Chernukhin for a 2018 high court case against oligarch Oleg Deripaska, details how he built his fortune and networked with some of his countryâ€™s richest oligarchs. It discloses that he built a personal investment portfolio while working in â€œofficial rolesâ€<9d>, including chairman of the now-sanctioned Russian state development corporation VEB.RF. Chernukhin says in the statement: â€œIn the relevant period up to 2004, it was widely accepted that those who held public positions such as mine would also be interested in projects in the private sector. Some discretion was required â€¦ but the reality was that I (along with many other people at my level in the Russian Federation) held many private interestsâ€¦ â€œMy time at VEB and in government elevated me to the inner circles of the Russian establishment, opened up an array of high-level connections for me and deepened my knowledge of the Russian economy.â€<9d> He said he invested in projects in a variety of sectors, often as joint shareholder with â€œprominent members of the Russian economic establishmentâ€<9d>. In evidence in the high court in December 2018, he confirmed that he â€œwas doing business with people like Abramovich, Deripaska, [Andrey] Melnichenko.â€<9d> He said: â€œWe were like friends. And we knew everything about each other, especially because all of us came from Soviet Union with zero money in the pocket.â€<9d> Abramovich, Deripaska and Melnichenko have all been sanctioned by the UK government. Melnichenko was worth an estimated Â£11bn before the Ukraine invasion and his â‚¬530m (Â£441m) super yacht was seized this month by the Italian authorities. According to Chernukhinâ€™s statement, when he left VEB in 2004 after being dismissed by Putin, his annual income for that year was $55m (Â£42m), on which he paid tax of about $1.5m (Â£1.1m). Trustees were required to oversee his investments when he was in ministerial office. The case involved a dispute over the ownership of a valuable piece of land in Moscow. The judge found Chernukhin was a legitimate investor and a joint venture partner with Deripaska. There is no suggestion Chernukhin acted unlawfully in his business dealings in Russia. Chernukhin amassed his fortune in a career that included working for trade houses run by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and VEB. He was deputy finance minister of the Russian Federation for two years from April 2000, then became chairman of VEB. He was also a board member of major Russian companies, including the state-owned airline Aeroflot. He left for England in 2004, fearing he might be the victim of bogus charges and political persecution. He said he was close to former prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov, now a Putin critic and opposition figure. It has been previously reported that financial documents suggest Chernukhin left the country with assets of about $500m (Â£366m). Chernukhin married Lubov, a former banking consultant, in 2007. Her donations to the Conservatives include successful auction bids for tennis with Boris Johnson and a dinner party with Theresa May. Her large donations helped secure her membership of a Conservative party â€œadvisory boardâ€<9d> for major donors which provides regular access to the prime minister and chancellor. The Pandora papers leak, which exposed the finances of the super-rich, suggested Lubov Chernukhinâ€™s money flowed, at least in part, from her husbandâ€™s corporate structures. A document sent in 2017 for financial compliance purposes is said to have described her as â€œfinancially supported by her husbandâ€<9d>. The papers also revealed the couple owned a Â£30m townhouse overlooking Londonâ€™s Regent Park and a Â£10m Oxfordshire country house. It also revealed the couple regularly chartered their own superyacht to sail around the south of France and the Caribbean. They also rented their own private jet, registered in the Isle of Man. The couple both have British citizenship. A spokesperson for the Chernukhins said Lubovâ€™s donations were from her own money, and any suggestion to the contrary was false. The spokesperson said: â€œMrs Chernukhinâ€™s donations â€¦ have never been tainted by Kremlin or any other influence. All donations have been made and declared in accordance with Electoral Commission rules.â€<9d> Mrs Chernukhin has condemned the â€œtruly horrifyingâ€<9d> invasion of Ukraine and has said Putinâ€™s â€œdespotic regimeâ€<9d> has degraded to â€œStalinist persecutionâ€<9d> of the Russian people. The spokesperson said Mr Chernukhin was not a state employee while at the trade house of the Ministry of Foreign Trade or VEB, and was entitled to engage in private entrepreneurial activities. No authority in any jurisdiction has ever suggested or alleged wrongdoing on his part. The spokesperson said: â€œMr Chernukhin served as deputy finance minister under Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov. Mr Chernukhin fled Russia â€¦ when it became known that Mr Kasyanov was forming organised opposition to President Putin.â€<9d> Lawyers for the Chernukhins have previous said they consider documents in the Pandora papers were obtained unlawfully and dispute the accuracy of the reporting on them. A Conservative spokesperson said the party â€œonly accepts donations from permissible sources, namely individuals registered on the UKâ€™s electoral roll or UK-registered companies. Donations are properly â€¦ declared to the Electoral Commission, openly published by them and comply fully with the law.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

The hosts, fighting relegation, put in an admirable performance to disrupt the championsâ€™ rhythm but a Pernille Harder penalty in the 71st minute gave Chelsea the three points as conditions worsened amid heavy rain. â€œThank goodness, to be honest,â€<9d> said a relieved Emma Hayes as her team retained the initiative in the title race. â€œI donâ€™t think we should let it get to that point. However, letâ€™s credit Birmingham. They were fighting for their lives; they fought for every ball.

Will there be more twists and turns? SD A double dose of Miedema magic â€œWe want you to stay.â€<9d> Those were the cries ringing around Meadow Park, directed at Vivianne Miedema, as she scored twice to lead Arsenal to a 7-0 dismantling of Aston Villa. The Dutch strikerâ€™s contract runs out this summer. Her supposed destination? Barcelona. Jonatan GirÃ¡ldezâ€™s team have been ripping it up in the Primera DivisiÃ³n, and are in the Champions League final after putting five goals past Wolfsburg in front of 91,648 at the Camp Nou in the semi-final first leg. Would Miedema slot into his team? Sundayâ€™s double suggested as much; she was denied a hat-trick only by Sian Rogersâ€™ outstanding goalkeeping. Although Jonas Eidevall mentioned incorporating â€œthe BarÃ§a cultureâ€<9d> in his post-match press conference, Arsenalâ€™s manager may have to go to some lengths to persuade Miedema to reject the dream move. Perhaps snatching the title from Chelseaâ€™s grasp in their last game could do the trick. MN â€¢ Match report: Arsenal 7-0 Aston Villa Determined United show attacking flair â€œManchester United teams try to attack â€“ they love attacking, they love scoring goals; this is a real spirit of a Manchester United team,â€<9d> said Marc Skinner of his teamâ€™s offensive display against West Ham. Foot on the pedal from the first whistle, they bounced back in style from last weekâ€™s goalless disappointment against Aston Villa. With United afforded more space than they should have been, Katie Zelem was able to spray quarter-back-style passes around the pitch and the pace of Leah Galton and Ona Batlle down the flanks was integral. Their three goals came from Martha Thomas, an own goal and Galton but it could and should have been more. It was a high-quality performance to fill them with confidence before a crucial final-day showdown at Chelsea. SD Shaw doubles league goal tally Khadija â€˜Bunnyâ€™ Shaw had a remarkable game against Brighton as she hit four goals in Manchester Cityâ€™s 7-2 victory which maintained their top-three hopes. Jamaica international Shaw, who signed for City last summer, headed into the fixture with four Womenâ€™s Super League goals. But she was in a scoring frenzy on Saturday and had two within 12 minutes. The forward fired home two more goals in the second half, which led her teammate Chloe Kelly to question Shawâ€™s pre-match routine. â€œTo get four is an unbelievable feeling,â€<9d> Shaw told the club website. â€œThatâ€™s the objective, thatâ€™s what my team looks to me for: to score goals. Kelly asked me what I had for breakfast! It was the same thing I had for breakfast all year!â€<9d> City sit a point behind third-placed Manchester United but with a crucial game in hand. Beat bottom-placed Birmingham on Wednesday and City will control their own destiny in the race for third place and Champions League qualification. SR Spurs lack finishing touch Everton, who have failed to win in their past seven matches across all competitions, were able to hold Spurs to a 2-2 draw at Walton Hall Park. The visitors have let third place slip in recent weeks, so perhaps it wasnâ€™t all that surprising that they were unable to see off their opponents. But with Tottenham having 23 shots, including 10 on target, this game was shaped by their lack of finesse â€“ a problem since their 3-0 defeat by Manchester United in January. Allowing Megan Finnigan to equalise in stoppage time was painful punishment.

Blasts were heard at about 6am on Friday, preceded by the sound of air raid sirens, as a mushroom-shaped plume of smoke could be seen rising in the sky. Lvivâ€™s mayor, Andriy Sadovy, said the civilian airport had not been hit and that authorities were assessing the situation and would issue updates. Emergency vehicles raced to the scene, while motorists were turned away at checkpoints, the Agence France-Presse news agency reported. The Ukrainian air force said the aircraft repair plant was struck by cruise missiles fired from the direction of the Black Sea and that other Russian missiles were reportedly shot down by Ukrainian anti-aircraft defences before reaching their target. The plant was not in operation at the time of the strike and so far no casualties have been reported, Sadovy said. According to officials, the missiles â€“ most likely Kh-555 weapons launched from heavy strategic bombers â€“ had not directly hit Danylo Halytskyi airport in Lviv, where, before being closed after the invasion, passengers could fly to more than 50 international destinations, including Madrid, London, Paris, Milan, Venice, Catania and Barcelona. Lviv, a Unesco world heritage site, had been largely untouched by Russian bombing until Friday, although many of its 700,000 inhabitants had feared an attack was a matter of time. â€œEverybody knew sooner or later they would bomb Lviv,â€<9d> said Maria Butkevych , 20, medical student from Kherson, who arrived in the city after the Russian invasion. â€œIâ€™m still surprised that the airport is still standing. The Russians are closing in, but Iâ€™m not leaving again. Iâ€™ll stay here, until this war is over.â€<9d> The city has been described as the soul of Ukraine and a symbol of Ukrainian nationalism. Its citizens were among the strongest supporters of the countryâ€™s separation from the Soviet Union. Since the Russian invasion began, Lviv has rapidly transformed into a garrison town. It is the centre of the countryâ€™s nationalist movement and, with its civil airport and military airfield, residents knew the town would have been in Russiaâ€™s sights. During the advance of Russian troops on Kyiv, foreign embassies have been transferred to Lviv, with the city becoming the new diplomatic capital of Ukraine and centre of the western response. Here, thousands of displaced people seeking shelter arrive every day at the railway station from eastern cities razed to the ground by airstrikes. There are at least 200,000 internally displaced people in Lviv, stretching the cityâ€™s capacity to its limits.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

His name is Alfie â€“ a Eurasian eagle owl, one of the largest species in the world that is not native to Britain. In one of the most recent sightings, Alfie took Hattie Atkinson Smith by surprise on Monday as she jogged near Carrow Road stadium, home to Norwich City football club, whose nickname is the Canaries. â€œI felt something on the back of my head, like fingers. I thought it was a person, pushing their hand down over my head,â€<9d> she said. â€œI looked up, and there was this absolutely ginormous bird.â€<9d> Startled but unhurt, Atkinson Smith watched the bird fly away and land on an apartment balcony. â€œI could tell it was a bird of prey but I thought it was too big to be an owl â€¦ I got a really good look at it.â€<9d> Atkinson Smith, a data-science manager, later identified the bird on Google as a Eurasian eagle owl. The birds are easily recognised by their striking orange eyes and tufted ears, as well as their size â€“ weighing up to 4kg, with a wingspan of nearly 2 metres. Norwich Evening News has been reporting regularly on sightings of â€œNorwichâ€™s favourite bird of preyâ€<9d> and was this week able to explain the birdâ€™s backstory. Alfieâ€™s owner, Peter Murphy, told the newspaper that he had been caring for Alfie for four years before the bird was accidentally let loose from his aviary in Lakenham in 2020. Murphy said he hoped to recapture his much-loved pet â€“ but urged city folk not to approach the owl â€œunless you have a very long net â€¦ he is a very dangerous bird in the wrong handsâ€<9d>.. But Chris Sperring, a conservation officer at the Hawk and Owl Trust, said Alfie had been loose long enough to resist giving up his freedom. â€œI think its chances in the wild are pretty darn good.â€<9d> Eurasian eagle owls are no longer native to Britain, meaning no records are kept of their numbers in captivity, but escaped pets have been known to thrive in the wild and even breed. There is also speculation that the birds may reach Britain from continental Europe, where wild populations have returned. But the chances of Alfie finding love in Norwich, Sperring suggests, are remote â€“ which may be behind his recent high profile, swooping pedestrians and waking people up with loud hooting at 2am. â€œItâ€™s fuelled up, its hormones are running high because of the wonderful Norfolk diet, and itâ€™s saying, â€˜Where are you? Why arenâ€™t you answering me? Come on!â€™â€<9d> Sperring said. Alfieâ€™s encounter with Atkinson Smith may have even been an attempt to initiate pair-bonding (not to mate, Sperring clarifies, â€œunless heâ€™s presenting food to the joggerâ€<9d>). â€œHeâ€™s going to what he knows, and thatâ€™s people.â€<9d> In February 2015, a Gloucester woman broke her arm while running away from an overeager eagle owl. But Sperring says Alfie is unlikely to pose a threat to any Norwich residents larger than a squirrel. As the apex owl species, eagle owls were often depicted as â€œhyped-up super owlsâ€<9d>, Sperring said. â€œBut when youâ€™re actually up close you realise thereâ€™s an awful lot of feathers.â€<9d> Atkinson Smith has since been for runs on Carrow Road without further encounters with Alfie. â€œItâ€™s not a dangerous bird, it obviously just confused me for something smaller,â€<9d> she said. â€œIâ€™ve just been keeping my head up.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

That, at any rate, was last yearâ€™s favourite theory: that post-pandemic theatre, seeking security by turning to familiar musicals and plays, was likely to go tepid. Here is a week that proves the conclusion wrong. Two revivals â€“ one restaging of a brilliant 13-year-old production, one complete remaking of an 82-year-old play â€“ are both in turn rousing and disturbing. Both are unmissable. Jez Butterworthâ€™s Jerusalem first burst into the Royal Court in 2009, bringing a luscious roll of language, a group of wayward spirits new to the stage and a 3D sensuality (smells reeked off the boards). Mark Rylanceâ€™s performance as Johnny â€œRoosterâ€<9d> Byron proved to be one of the most magnificent acting events of the past 20 years. Centring on a caravan dweller/drug dealer/free spirit and his followers â€“ disapproved of, opposed and eventually set upon by the residents of a local estate and the council â€“ the play swings beautifully, painfully between celebration and lament. Today its hedonism is more strongly laced with alarm. Director Ian Rickson preserves his original staging without embalming it. Ultzâ€™s design features the same glade, in which the action buzzes but the air seems still, and where, thanks to thoughtful lighting by Mimi Jordan Sherin, it is sometimes hard to know whether the glow is fading or growing. Certain references â€“ among them a joke about â€œSpooky Spiceâ€<9d> â€“ make it a striking portrait of its time. Other aspects have accrued a grimmer, sadder tinge. In the post-Brexit age of refugees, the lad from the abattoir who considers anyone outside Wiltshire a foreigner becomes a more significant figure. In a post-#MeToo world the young girls who flit around snorting and flirting look more obviously threatened. Mackenzie Crook is again subtly wistful as the perpetually disappointed would-be DJ, playing with the zip of his jacket as if it were an instrument. Indra OvÃ© is particularly memorable as Roosterâ€™s former lover, Dawn, caught between hardness and melting. Still, it is Rylance who makes this a St Crispinâ€™s Day moment: think yourself accursed you were not there. His combination of physicality and verbal nimbleness is unique. He does a headstand into a water trough, flicks a firelighter like a juggling toy, suggests his roosterishness with winglike elbows. He delivers with ardour his magic and bonkersness: this is the man who, just down the road from a Little Chef, came across the giant who built Stonehenge. A master of the pause and apparent stumble, his words bubble up from a blur of hesitation and chaos, flaming into life against a dark background, like the play itself. Everything about The Corn Is Green is right, for the National and the nation. Not green but ripe for this moment. Emlyn Williamsâ€™s 1938 play shows the UK as the divided country it still is. It stars a schoolteacher: when has the need for learning seemed more pressing? That schoolteacher is an unmarried woman: the stage â€“ as hinted at in Scandaltown last month â€“ is waking up to the fact that not all women without husbands have wasted lives. Dominic Cookeâ€™s production rewires the drama so that its historical importance is shown, its autobiographical element made vivid, its currency made vivacious. At the centre, Nicola Walker â€“ she of The Split and Unforgotten â€“ plays the teacher, Miss Moffat: Williams, a tremendous phrase-maker, described the real-life character on which she was based as having â€œeyes like a boxer smacking a punch-ballâ€<9d>. Walker catches that exactly: never tremulous nor trembling but quickening to everything around her (though, having, it turns out, a blind spot). Arriving in a Welsh village, Miss Moffat finds that 10-year-old boys, working down the pit, cannot read or write. They are Welsh speakers: we might as well be in a foreign country, grumbles one of the local toffs. She takes up a particularly gifted boy â€“ an essay in which he talks of reaching out of the darkness of the mine gives its title to the play. She teaches him Greek, she enters him for Oxford, she takes him away from his old life. This is a story full of feeling, verging on the sentimental, and one that in its later stages has several unlikely plot twists. But it is not psychologically blunt â€“ Williams knew about the dangers of saviourism â€“ and Cooke rescues it from its difficulties by a great wheeze. A man in a tux circles the evening, coming from glitter and ballroom, sinking back into memory: the playwright is constructing the play in front of our eyes, delivering stage directions and once stopping the action to rerun it. It is a device that gives edge to the sometimes soft focus and to period-piece characters such as the stuffed-shirt squire. It also brings home the fact that this is the playwrightâ€™s own story: Williams himself starred in the first production. Circling the stage a male voice choir, singers dressed as miners, tugs at the heart. One of the subtleties of Cookeâ€™s production is that the men sing not the boisterous Men of Harlech (as in the Bette Davis movie of The Corn Is Green) but Calon LÃ¢n, the song that wishes for a pure heart. They light up the stalls. Jackie Sibblies Druryâ€™s new play Marys Seacole also seeks to show how past and present are fused: in this case by racism and misogyny, which runs down through generations. Drury is a true playwright: her 2019 play Fairview plunged audiences into disarray with a tremendous coup de theatre, confronting the spectators with their own expectations about black and white characters. She has a magnetic subject in Mary Seacole, the pioneering nurse sometimes dubiously called â€œthe black Florence Nightingaleâ€<9d> (why not the other way round?). Nadia Latifâ€™s production has in Kayla Meikle an actor who burns steadily â€“ bold and visionary in a series of incarnations. Marys Seacole is a string of impassioned fragments in which Seacole is imagined as a succession of Marys: the historic figure in starched black robe and lace cuffs, being patronised by Nightingale, and as her blue-uniformed, latter-day NHS counterpart, treated with casual condescension by white visitors. Despite vivid flashes â€“ in particular, the reconstruction of a practice emergency response to a terrorist incident â€“ the play is often sluggishly overexplicit. There is fizzingly dextrous acting from Esther Smith and Olivia Williams, playing a multiplicity of roles. Still, the century-leaping scenes, topped and tailed by long, explanatory speeches at the beginning and end of the evening, reinforce rather than inflect each other.

The anticipation has been building like a drum fill since the two teams beat New Zealand on back-to-back Saturdays last November. Right now, the world rankings will tell you that Ireland are the best team in Europe. The French, who were, after all, the last team to beat Ireland when they won 15-13 in Dublin last year, believe differently. They are playing to settle that, the shot at the grand slam, and something more, too. The winner will step forward full of confidence that they can beat the best teams in the biggest games, with the ringing conviction that they are the top team. The loser will have to live with the knowledge that they came up short when it counted most, and deal with the doubt that follows a step backwards. At the start of the week, you could have made a case that the Irish were just about favourites, even though they are going away from home. They had played pitilessly well against Wales last Saturday, while France had had a harder time getting past Italy a day later. And then the news broke that Johnny Sexton had strained a hamstring and would miss this game. In a match as finely poised as this, that was enough, all of a sudden, to tilt the balance back the other way. â€œThatâ€™s sport,â€<9d> said Irelandâ€™s head coach, Andy Farrell. His team had trained for this, rehearsed it in practice, swapping Sexton and his replacement Joey Carbery in and out for the last three weeks. The gameâ€™s never just about one man, Farrell said, and heâ€™s right. His Ireland team have grown over the last year, winning nine games on the bounce, and donâ€™t depend on Sexton like they used to. But itâ€™s true, too, that some players are easier to do without than others, and Sexton, the man who won the game with a 45-metre drop-goal the last time Ireland won in Paris, is about the last one Farrell would want to lose. For Ireland, then, the game has become a different sort of test. The question in front of them now is how theyâ€™ll go without their captain and playmaker, and whether Carbery, who has played so well off the bench since he made his debut in 2016, is the man to take over when Sexton has finally gone for good. Itâ€™s an issue they have been worrying about on and off for the last few years. It even came up in the last World Cup, when Sexton was forced out of Irelandâ€™s pool match against Japan with a thigh injury. On that occasion, Farrellâ€™s predecessor Joe Schmidt picked Jack Carty to start, and put Carbery on the bench. Ireland lost 19-12. This time, Farrell has them the other way round. Even so, the Irish have been talking a good game. The players and coaches have sounded calm and confident all week. â€œWeâ€™re very clear on where weâ€™re sitting at the moment, how weâ€™ve developed our game, how weâ€™re playing the game,â€<9d> says the scrum coach John Fogarty. â€œWeâ€™ve played France twice in the last two years, when we came here last time out we didnâ€™t feel as ready as we do now.â€<9d> They sound like a team who know exactly how they want to win. â€œThereâ€™s going to be times when we have to muscle up, but in general we want to be on our feet, we donâ€™t want to be on the ground, and we donâ€™t want to be clustered in any parts of the field. Hopefully we can spend more time playing the game than in an arm-wrestle.â€<9d> The question is how well that plan holds up when the French bring the hammer down on it. Their head coach, Fabien GalthiÃ©, has brought the burly FranÃ§ois Cros into the back row to bolster his monumental pack, and loaded his bench with six forwards too. Theyâ€™ll look to soften Ireland up, and then strike. The chances are there will be a moment in there, somewhere, when itâ€™s all Ireland can do to stay in the game. Farrell knows it, and has tried to prepare his team for it. â€œThereâ€™s no doubt that France are going to have a purple patch, itâ€™s an absolute given,â€<9d> Farrell says, â€œHow we get back on task is going to be key for both sides, no doubt about that.â€<9d> If they can hold on through that stretch, then the game may come down to the replacements. Itâ€™s a sign of just how strong this Ireland squad is that they have five British and Irish Lions on the bench. If the match is still in the balance at that point, it might be the young French side who start to feel the pressure. As GalthiÃ© put it, in his own inimitable way, â€œwe are touching the summit of European rugby, the sublime side of the European game.â€<9d> Which, if you need the translation, is his way of saying itâ€™s going to be a hell of a match.",FALSE,"pillar/sport","Sport"

In a little village on the Sinai peninsula she came across a place that taught â€œfree divingâ€<9d> â€“ underwater diving without any breathing apparatus â€“ and decided to give it a try. â€œI held my breath for four minutes and I dove to 18 metres,â€<9d> says Bourke, who is the current womenâ€™s Australian pool and depth freediving champion. â€œAnd both of those things, I didnâ€™t realise was possible.â€<9d> Bourke had been a champion synchronised swimmer when she was a teenager, so already knew she could hold her breath for several minutes at a time. But discovering free diving â€œjust opened my eyes to the possibilities â€¦ and I just got hooked on a feeling of diving deeper and wanted to see what I was capable of and how deep I could go.â€<9d> By 2018, Bourke had established herself as one of the best competitive free divers in the world, and in deep waters off the coast of the Philippines, was ready to attempt to break the womenâ€™s world record in the discipline of â€œconstant weight no finsâ€<9d>. Considered one of the most challenging forms of the sport, a diver descends vertically in deep water on a single breath, using only muscle strength to propel them downwards. With every metre of descent, the compressive pressure on the body increases, shrinking the spaces that contain air. By 30 metres down â€“ the maximum depth physiologists in the early days of the sport thought humans were capable of reaching â€“ the pressure exerted on the body is four times greater than on the surface and the volume of air inside the body has shrunk to one quarter. Once negative buoyancy is reached, the diver begins to freefall. Bourke reached a depth of 73 metres â€“ a world record â€“ but a split second blackout once she reached the surface disqualified her. â€œIf you stay underwater long enough, thereâ€™s always the chance that your oxygen will drop to a level where your brain will decide to shut down in order to protect itself from brain damage,â€<9d> Bourke says. â€œSo, in a way, itâ€™s a good thing â€¦ but frustrating at the end of a long dive.â€<9d> The menâ€™s world record for â€œconstant weight no finsâ€<9d> is 102 metres, taking four minutes and 14 seconds. With fins, it is 131 metres. For the discipline of â€œstatic apneaâ€<9d>, where a competitor doesnâ€™t dive but just submerges themselves under water, the longest breath-hold is 11 minutes and 54 seconds. When 100% oxygen is breathed in prior to the attempt, the record is 24 minutes and 37 seconds. Dr Anthony Bain, a vascular physiologist from the University of Windsor in Canada, has researched the physiology of extreme breath-holding â€“ including conducting experiments with elite free divers â€“ and says many of those at the professional level have larger lung volumes than the average person. Studies in native diving populations, for example the Bajau people in south-east Asia, â€œhave also demonstrated larger spleens, which will theoretically allow for longer breath holds via splenic contraction and release of oxygen bound red blood cellsâ€<9d>. Primarily, however, the ability to survive while submerged for a prolonged time is a learned skill. According to Bain, studies suggest that elite free divers have â€œenhancedâ€<9d> their Mammalian Dive Response. Theorised to be an evolutionary adaptation â€“ a vestige from billions of years ago when all life was aquatic â€“ itâ€™s a reflex thatâ€™s triggered when a mammalâ€™s face comes into contact with water. It prompts a number of physiological responses that promote survival, such as the slowing of the heart rate and metabolism, and a redirection of blood to vital organs, including to the lungs to bolster them against pressure. While Bourke doesnâ€™t know if she has any innate physiological differences â€“ she has never been tested â€“ she knows that over a decade of training she has learned how to better use the space in her lungs. Even at 70 metres down, she can still â€œbring inâ€<9d> more air from her lungs. Free diving is gaining popularity as a pastime, with schools popping up along the Australian coastline, but becoming an elite free diver takes patience. Progression is slow â€“ it often takes years to achieve several extra metres in depth, as the body becomes accustomed to pressure. â€œWhen I first dove to 30 metres deep, I really felt a lot of pressure on my body, and especially on my chest, it feels like youâ€™re being crushed,â€<9d> Bourke says. â€œBut now, diving to 70 meters, I donâ€™t feel that pressure at all.â€<9d> The major adaptation though is psychological: developing a conscious ability to withstand the urge to breathe. According to Bain, an untrained person starts to undergo â€œinvoluntary breathing movementsâ€<9d> after no longer than two to three minutes underwater, when the â€œbody has barely desaturated with oxygenâ€<9d>. Elite free divers, however, are able to mentally push through this point, holding their breath until they â€œmajorly desaturate their blood of oxygenâ€<9d>. Among free diving instructors, like Clinton Laurence from the Gold Coast, who is also a clinical psychologist, psychological strategies such as mindfulness are key to training. â€œThat is where you observe the thought, â€˜I have to breatheâ€™,â€<9d> he says. â€œBut you just observe it. â€˜Yep, thereâ€™s that thought again. Thatâ€™s OK.â€™ And you just keep going.â€<9d> Bourke says she enters a â€œmeditative stateâ€<9d> by slowing her breathing before she enters the water. Then, â€œitâ€™s about maintaining that relaxed state, and for me, thatâ€™s really about staying in the moment and not thinking too far into the future, because if you think about how long youâ€™re planning to stay under water and how deep youâ€™re planning to dive, then itâ€™s easy to get overwhelmed and to panic.â€<9d> While the pandemic has stalled most international competitions, Bourke is still training â€“ she does long sessions swimming underwater in the pool around four times a week, plus working out in the gym â€“ alongside her work as an electrician and a free-diving instructor. Once competition resumes, sheâ€™ll be back pursuing world records. â€œWhen I first started, I was like, â€˜I didnâ€™t even know this was humanly possibleâ€™, but itâ€™s just amazing what humans can do.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Each of them encouraged increasing levels of openness and entrenched the message: sharing prompts caring or, better yet, attention. For much of my life, almost everything became fodder to be shared online. Funny texts from friends, videos of strangers on the street, stray thoughts about sexual proclivities. Privacy, both mine and that of the people I came into contact with, was a mythical concept. If I had experienced something, surely that made it my anecdote, to do with as I pleased? This approach caused problems. A man I was dating texted me to ask if a particular rant about bad communicators was about him (yes). A colleague warned me about sharing pictures in my underwear, prompting a furious reaction. Family fractures resulted from drunk tweets. But why, I would think defiantly, should I censor myself? Over the past two years, though, something has changed: Iâ€™ve started to properly pull back, prompted by the ongoing presence in my life of someone I love very deeply, whose attitude to privacy is the antithesis of mine. I had learned to see sharing as widely as possible as an act of pride. To me, posting a candid photograph to 10,000 followers was akin to loudly claiming my beloved for the world to see. He took a different view: attention from faceless avatars meant nothing to him. Why, he asked, did I feel compelled to perform my life for these people? It was a good question and one I wasnâ€™t quite able to articulate an answer to, becoming defensive at first. Even now, Iâ€™m not sure thereâ€™s a single way to understand the drive to broadcast every facet of my existence. Perhaps the simplest explanation is that oversharing was a behaviour I learned early â€“ as a toddler, my mother tells me I would run around, pointing at people and announcing what genitalia I surmised they had, informed by the iconic 1973 kidsâ€™ sex education book Where Did I Come From? â€“ and engaging in it resulted in an incredible amount of positive reinforcement as I grew older. There are other reasons of course: realisations and breakthroughs Iâ€™ve had since beginning the process of redrawing my boundaries. But Iâ€™ll keep those to myself. Another factor was starting out as a lifestyle journalist in the twilight of the 2010s. A first-person essay boom was in full swing and leveraging your personal life was one of the few routes to get noticed if you lacked contacts or journalism qualifications. Young women desperate to stand out from the crowd were coaxed into sharing intimate, and often traumatic, details about their lives for clicks. In this arena, to lay yourself bare was an act of ambition â€“ one, we later discovered, that can be difficult to scrub from the internet. Meanwhile, a new crop of digital-first and reality TV celebrities had emerged, defined by their â€œauthenticityâ€™â€<9d> and willingness to present their entire existence for public consumption. Positive reinforcement for laying it all on the metaphorical table was high. Reprogramming yourself is a fascinating exercise. The urge to share is most insistent when Iâ€™m alone, prompting the horrific realisation that somewhere along the way, my brain has been trained to process reality through an audience. Sharing became how I made my own life real; if a tree fell in a forest, and I didnâ€™t tweet about it, did it even happen? At times, I feel like something terrible and irreversible has taken place; that Iâ€™ll never be able to walk down a street listening to a beautiful piece of music and not get the urge to convert the sheer joy of the experience into a social media post, or a text to a friend to make it real. But every time I resist that grubby pull, thereâ€™s a small rush of triumph â€“ and liberation. Now Iâ€™ve had a taste of what keeping things close feels like, I crave it. Itâ€™s a delicious secret, a reclamation of power I wasnâ€™t aware Iâ€™d surrendered. Choosing what to share, with who and when, prompts necessary pauses â€“ do I really need to mention this detail? Is this information I want out there long term? Do I even have the necessary consent to trumpet a certain story to all and sundry? None of this means Iâ€™ve stopped sharing altogether. That would be a lonely life indeed. But I have become far more selective about exactly what information reaches an audience wider than my inner circle (and Iâ€™m not alone; there is a burgeoning backlash against oversharing, counting Taylor Swift and some UK teens among its converts). Last year, I read the playwright Joe Ortonâ€™s diaries, published after his 1967 murder. As detailed in John Lahrâ€™s introduction to The Orton Diaries, Orton always intended for posthumous publication of the work and believed â€œthe value of a diary was its franknessâ€<9d>. His entries are the last word in confessional writing. But they were penned safe in the knowledge that the public would only read them after Orton was long gone. As a result, the man who jumps off the page feels utterly free, for better or worse. Iâ€™m now realising that complete openness was limiting. Privacy is a cloak, under which we are at liberty to explore the intricacies of the self, beholden to no audience other than ourselves. I have grown up in a generation that overshares in order to be heard. Only through the slow, gruelling process of learning to be private am I really beginning to listen to myself.

The inquiry began in September 2020 and heard its final submissions on Tuesday after 196 days of often harrowing evidence. Twenty-two people died on 22 May 2017 when Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old born and bred in Manchester with Libyan roots, detonated a suicide bomb hidden in his rucksack. Kim Harrison, a lawyer from Slater 7 Gordon who represents the families of 12 of the 22 victims, praised the bereaved for their â€œdignity, patience and great strengthâ€<9d>. She said: â€œWith each chapter of the inquiry heard our clients have had to sit and listen to a catalogue of organisational failings at every turn â€“ from failings with the running of the arena and its security and medical provision, to failings of the emergency services on the night and latterly to the failures of the security services including MI5 and CPT [counter-terror police] to keep their loved ones safe that night. â€œLearning how badly their loved ones were failed by all those organisations has greatly exacerbated their grief and suffering.â€<9d> She thanked members of the public and some of the emergency services who committed â€œacts of true heroismâ€<9d> to step in selflessly to help in what was a very dangerous situation. She added: â€œThe families we represent desperately want something positive to come from this inquiry and for real changes to be made to keep members of the public safer from acts of terrorism in the future.â€<9d> The inquiry is aiming to publish its second report, which examines the actions of the emergency services, before the parliamentary summer recess, set provisionally for 22 July. Volume 3, which looks at the security services, will be published separately later in the year. The first report, published by the chairman of the inquiry last year, found that Abedi should have been identified as a security threat on the night of the attack. Sir John Saunders found there were â€œserious shortcomingsâ€<9d> and a number of missed opportunities by those in charge of security to prevent the attack. Saunders said he considered it likely Abedi would still have detonated his device if confronted, â€œbut the loss of life and injury is highly likely to have been lessâ€<9d>. Harrison said: â€œOn behalf of those we represent, we urge the inquiry to be equally clear-sighted and brave in its chapter 2 and 3 reports dealing with the actions of the emergency services and the security services, to ensure that real change is effected and this country becomes a safer place out of this dreadful act of terror.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

The draft opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito and obtained by Politico in a highly unusual and possibly unprecedented leak from the nationâ€™s highest court, would strike down Roe, the landmark supreme court decision that has guaranteed access to abortion for nearly half a century, and a subsequent 1992 decision â€“ Planned Parenthood v Casey â€“ that largely upheld that right. â€œRoe was egregiously wrong from the start,â€<9d> Alito wrote in the draft opinion labeled â€œfirst draftâ€<9d>, which was not expected to be finalized for at least several more weeks and could change in its final form. The question of whether abortion should be legal, Alito argues, is best answered by individual states. In a statement on Tuesday, the supreme court confirmed the authenticity of the draft report but cautioned that it â€œdoes not represent a decision by the court or the final position of any member on the issues in the caseâ€<9d>. Nevertheless, as the revelation reverberated across Washington, protesters gathered in front of the supreme court on Tuesday morning, shouting loudly enough to be heard by the members of Congress arriving for work at the Capitol. From the White House, Joe Biden urged voters to elect political leaders who would act to protect abortion access and reproductive rights, irrespective of the supreme courtâ€™s final decision. â€œIf the court does overturn Roe, it will fall on our nationâ€™s elected officials at all levels of government to protect a womanâ€™s right to choose,â€<9d> Biden said in a statement. â€œAnd it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November. At the federal level, we will need more pro-choice senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that codifies Roe, which I will work to pass and sign into law.â€<9d> Strategists were preparing for a decision that either weakened or reversed Roe, but the leak upended the expected timetable and, potentially, the legislative agenda. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said he would bring legislation to the floor that would codify abortion access in federal law. But the measure is unlikely to garner the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate. A similar measure passed by the Democratic-controlled House last year does not even have the support of all 50 Democratic senators. â€œA vote on this legislation is not an abstract exercise. This is as urgent and real as it gets,â€<9d> Schumer said on the Senate floor on Tuesday. â€œWe will vote to protect a womanâ€™s right to choose and every American is going to see which side every senator stands.â€<9d> In anticipation of such a ruling by the supreme court, Republican-led states have proposed, and in many cases already passed, a cascade of restrictive anti-abortion laws. Conservative activists are pushing a nationwide ban on abortion if Republicans recapture control of Congress in November, as they are favored to do. In a flurry of statements and fundraising emails, Democrats argued that the erosion of reproductive rights was a reason to support them in the November midterms. â€œRepublicans just gutted Roe v Wade, the Constitutionâ€™s guarantee of reproductive freedom, and will ban abortion in all 50 states, if they take over Congress,â€<9d> the New York congressman Sean Patrick Maloney, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, wrote on Twitter. â€œOnly Democrats will protect our freedoms. That is now the central choice in the 2022 election.â€<9d> Democratic lawmakers and candidates condemned the expected decision, and vowed to protect access to abortion. â€œAs a pro-choice pastor, Iâ€™ve always believed that a patientâ€™s room is way too small for a woman, her doctor, and the United States government,â€<9d> wrote the Georgia senator Raphael Warnock, one of the most vulnerable Democrats up for re-election this cycle. â€œIâ€™ll always fight to protect a womanâ€™s right to choose. And that will never change.â€<9d> The Minnesota senator Tina Smith put it more bluntly: â€œThis is bullshit.â€<9d> Polls have consistently found that most Americans want Roe to remain the law of the land, and the vast majority want abortion to remain legal in at least some cases. A decision overturning Roe would be the culmination of a 50-year project by anti-abortion activists to remake the federal courts by using their political clout to pressure Republicans to appoint and confirm reliably conservative majorities. In 2016, Donald Trump sealed his support among conservative voters by vowing to nominate supreme court justices who opposed abortion. His presidency yielded three conservative justices, all of whom are reportedly in the majority voting to strike down Roe. They also refused to block a novel Texas law that has effectively outlawed abortion in the nationâ€™s second-largest state. But instead of celebrating the draft ruling, Republican lawmakers on Tuesday were almost singularly focused on the leak, expressing outrage over the disclosure that was likely to further undermine faith in the judiciary as an independent branch of government. â€œLast nightâ€™s stunning breach was an attack on the independence of the supreme court,â€<9d> the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, wrote in a statement. â€œBy every indication, this was yet another escalation in the radical leftâ€™s ongoing campaign to bully and intimidate federal judges and substitute mob rule for the rule of law.â€<9d> Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement that he had ordered the marshal of the court to open an investigation into the source of the leak. â€œThis was a singular and egregious breach of that trust that is an affront to the court and the community of public servants who work here,â€<9d> he said. While the nation awaits a final opinion, pro-choice activists are urging supporters to keep making their voices heard. â€œLetâ€™s be clear: this is a draft opinion. Itâ€™s outrageous, itâ€™s unprecedented, but it is not final,â€<9d> Planned Parenthood wrote on Twitter. â€œAbortion is your right â€“ and it is STILL LEGAL.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

In Barrieâ€™s 1904 play and 1911 novel, Wendy flies off from her London nursery, along with her two brothers, to follow Pan to Neverland. Once there, in an embodiment of Edwardian domestic virtues, she becomes a mother figure to Panâ€™s gang of Lost Boys. As Hickson points out in the programme, even in the early 20th century this was a limited view of a womanâ€™s role: â€œEmmeline Pankhurst and the suffragettes would have been on the front page of all the newspapers when Barrie [was writing].â€<9d> Hickson continues: â€œI wanted to give [Wendy] something to achieve, to strive for.â€<9d> Here, therefore, Wendy is on a quest: to find her own â€œlost boyâ€<9d> â€“ a third brother, Tom, who has died in the opening scenes of the play. Amber James skilfully brings out the complexities of Hicksonâ€™s Wendy: admirable in her courage and determination; moving in her vulnerability; trying to find her place in a boy-shaped world, and to make common cause with the bolshie Tink (Hope Kenna) and warrior-like Tiger Lily (Ami Okumura Jones). Jamesâ€™s Wendy is perfectly counterpointed by Pierro Niel-Meeâ€™s Pan, crowingly committed to leading his Lost Boys into battle against David Birrellâ€™s time-haunted Captain Hook and his pirate gang; fearless in the face of death, that â€œgreat adventureâ€<9d>, yet recoiling from responsibility and emotion. Hicksonâ€™s quest theme, however, never really meshes dramatically with Barrieâ€™s story. In spite of dynamic direction from Jonathan Munby and Rupert Hands, the action moves in fits and starts. That said, the production always looks spectacular. Developed by Leeds Playhouse along with the Japanese organisation Bunkamura, and first performed in Tokyo last year, its shifting sets (by Colin Richmond) and space-cheating projections (Taiki Ueda) set imaginations flying.

The corpse of a tramp was dressed up as fictitious â€œCapt William Martinâ€<9d> and carried elaborate bogus plans for this nonexistent invasion; the body was dumped into the sea so that it would wash up in Spain where the British were confident this phoney intelligence would be obediently passed to the Germans. Screenwriter Michelle Ashford has adapted the nonfiction bestseller by Ben Macintyre about this extraordinary adventure and John Madden directs, with Colin Firth and Matthew Macfadyen playing the stiff upper lipped chaps in charge, Ewen Montagu and Charles Cholmondeley. And Johnny Flynn plays naval intelligenceâ€™s brightest spark: Lt Cdr Ian Fleming (the future creator of James Bond, who possibly had the idea in the first place) in an entertainingly tongue-in-cheek performance. In many ways, the most important figure here is the MI5 clerk Jean Leslie (played by Kelly Macdonald) whose photo was placed on the body to be the fake captainâ€™s imagined â€œgirlfriendâ€<9d>. Leslieâ€™s supporting role is part of the way this film is striving for a rather modern emotional intelligence: it is less callous and more caring about the wretched homeless man being used in this way, and the leading players are pondering, like artists, their creation and the light he casts on their own stress and loneliness. It is a bit different from the previous film about Operation Mincemeat, The Man Who Never Was (1956), which was adapted directly from Montaguâ€™s own published memoir, and created a human-interest angle with an entirely fictional and slightly noir-ish subplot about a pro-German Irish spy who investigates the phoney girlfriend, played by Gloria Grahame. Did the real Operation Mincemeat do any good? This film doesnâ€™t commit itself, but hints at all sorts of spycraft double-bluff which may finally have done the job. This is another of the â€œhome front wartimeâ€<9d> Britfilms, such as Munich: The Edge of War, Their Finest, The Imitation Game and Darkest Hour, all probably inspired by the Oscar-winning success of The Kingâ€™s Speech, which have their emphasis on domestic morale, strategic ingenuity and political shenanigans, rather than battlefield action. Operation Mincemeat is watchable enough, but perhaps canâ€™t find a fictional way into the stranger-than-fiction outrageousness of the scheme itself. â€¢ Operation Mincemeat is released on 15 April in cinemas in the UK and on 25 April in Australia.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

She told of how farmers once phoned Lismore to warn that their rain gauges were filling and a flood was on the way; now the town relied on official forecasts that werenâ€™t always accurate. The lack of warning from authorities of the impending floods, on 28 February and 30 March, was one of the most prevalent themes at the town hall-style meeting, at which the inquiryâ€™s leaders, Professor Mary Oâ€™Kane, an engineer and scientist, and Mick Fuller, the former NSW police commissioner, explained they had come to listen, not provide answers. In the words of another speaker: â€œThere was no real clear warning that it was going to be as bad as it was.â€<9d> One northern rivers resident said he hadnâ€™t come to blame State Emergency Service volunteers or the local council, but their modelling systems appeared to be failing. An array of ideas was proffered from the floor. Blocks and tackles could be used to secure houses in flood plains and wetlands of native flora planted to divert water away from residential areas, because â€œlots of people still want to stay in this placeâ€<9d>. Flood mitigation could include dredging Lismore Wilsons River and restoring it to the deep channel once used by ships â€“ today itâ€™s barely fit for a dingy. First Nations land management practices needed to be adopted. The myriad of potholes in the region should be highlighted by white paint, because they were impossible to see at night on wet roads, and there were also calls to investigate whether the upgraded Pacific Highway had exacerbated flooding in some places. Some suggested flood-zone houses should have mandatory roof hatches, like skylights, to prevent people in attics being drowned by rising waters. There were multiple calls for the insurance system to be overhauled, community communications systems to be strengthened with satellite, and a testimony about the impact on wildlife. There were callouts for improved drainage and building flood-proof, because â€œclearly our infrastructure canâ€™t handle thisâ€<9d> and â€œdisaster planning must be incorporated into regional planningâ€<9d>. There were stories of trauma â€“ the neighbours were screaming; children saw their pets drown. One woman referenced a friend who perished while trying to be saved on Facebook, and a miraculous rescue tale â€“ someone was pulled from a strong torrent by a string of Christmas lights. There was even laughter when Byron Bay councillor Mark Swivel lamented the national mediaâ€™s focus on Byronâ€™s inundationâ€“ â€œthe flood came to Byron because apparently water likes linenâ€<9d>. The only agitation was when a woman spoke about being traumatised by the floods, which she attributed to climate change and a reliance on fossil fuels. She was met with applause and a couple of boos. Stories were told from an array of perspectives. Helen Coyle, who lives with a disability, described being stuck in Ballina, unable to return to her Lismore home because the roads were cut. She went to the Ballina hospital for help but said staff chastised her for travelling with insufficient money. She is calling for hospital staff to be kitted with the phone numbers for organisations that can support people with disabilities displaced by severe weather events. A subsequent indignity, she said, was that the floods have robbed Lismore of public disabled toilets, only portaloos. Are the disabled expected to â€œshit themselvesâ€<9d>? Another Lismore resident called on flood clean-up volunteers to be trained in what is salvageable because well-intentioned volunteers had thrown away her sonâ€™s two prosthetic legs. Bruno Ros, a vet specialising in large animals, spent the first post-flood days on helicopters looking for stranded livestock and visiting isolated farming properties. â€œPlenty of people were on the ground, barking, screaming and pleading for help,â€<9d> he said after the inquiry, â€œand for me as a vet the Department of Primary Industries was just inaccessible. I begged for assistance. It arrived seven days after the floods, seven days too late.â€<9d> Dr Cam Hollows, a doctor on the ground in Coraki, recounted working for 40 hours and treating 60 patients in the aftermath. â€œWeâ€™ve repeated every single mistake of the bushfires,â€<9d> he said. Lismore Labor MP Janelle Saffin agreed: â€œGovernment agencies werenâ€™t prepared, and they need to ramp up really quickly because thatâ€™s what disasters need, but they havenâ€™t done that.â€<9d> Mark Oâ€™Toole, from Bungawalbin, said he asked members on a community Facebook page if anyone had been successful in securing a government business grant: â€œSo far Iâ€™m up to 890 comments and nobody has got oneâ€<9d>. There are around 100 farmers just in his town, he said, and â€œthe money needs to start flowing now, not in six months or 12 months.â€<9d> A woman fought back tears as she described families with children still camping in backyards. Another outlined simple wishes: â€œIâ€™d just like a cupboard for my undies, a pantry for my food.â€<9d> For more than two hours the Lismore crowd listened in near silence â€“ a demonstration of forbearance and patience from a community that had already endured so much. The NSW flood inquiry will hold its next public hearing at the Tumbulgum Hall in the Tweed Shire on Wednesday. It is required to report to the premier by 30 September and is open to submissions from any member of the public, which can be made online, via email, post or phone.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Johnny Sexton, their captain and talisman, was not among them. He had been withdrawn with a few seconds left on the clock, presumably to grant him one last valedictory ovation from a Twickenham crowd that may never see him in action again. This is the sort of treatment Sexton should probably start getting used to over the coming months. Earlier in the week he finally ended months of speculation by revealing that his latest contract would be his last: a retirement announced 18 months in advance, taking him as far as the next World Cup in France. If the announcement itself was little surprise given that Sexton will be 38 by then and has already been fending off questions about his departure for half a decade, then there was also a certain curiosity to its timing. Nobody does the long farewell quite like the Irish: the moving montages, the floral bouquets, the touching tributes. The former winger Shane Horgan jokes that during Rory Bestâ€™s extended retirement tour of 2019, Bestâ€™s son Ben ended up spending more time on the Aviva pitch than he ever did. Brian Oâ€™Driscoll also announced his retirement almost a year in advance and in a recent Off The Ball podcast identified another possible pitfall of the drawn-out retirement: the procession of â€œlast eversâ€<9d>. Every game becomes your last at a certain venue, your last against a certain opponent, your last in a certain competition. The epilogue of your career unfolds against a background music of finality, loss and premature memorialisation. Of course, you have to assume Sexton is too much of a professional to be affected by any of this. But perhaps it has an effect on how the rest of us see and talk about him. For Andy Farrell and the strategists of Irish rugby, there are plans to be tweaked, successors to be auditioned. Sexton may have declared his intention to â€œattackâ€<9d> the final part of his career. But somehow once you start the clock ticking, it becomes impossible not to start imagining the bomb. There were times when you could almost sense Ireland beginning to process these questions in real time. Sexton didnâ€™t have a bad game, as such. He had a relatively quiet game, which in many ways was hardly his fault. Even so he kicked his points, kept things ticking over, exerted an austere calming influence on the decisive final stretch during which Ireland finally picked England off. But there was also a distinct absence of high notes, long periods spent on the margins watching the game explode around him, the maestro conducting an orchestra that nobody could hear. Afterwards Sexton talked about how Irelandâ€™s famous cohesion was a product of their immaculate preparation, the exhaustive drilling of players already familiar with each other from the club game. Perhaps by contrast, Irelandâ€™s struggles here sprang from a scenario they could scarcely have predicted, a game that unfolded in dazzlingly unfamiliar patterns. The early red card for Charlie Ewels added a note of chaos to a game already at high pitch, and as against 13-man Italy, here Ireland looked curiously scruffy and unsettled, seemingly in a rush to do everything at once. There were handling errors, dropped passes, passes to nobody. The Irish pack lost its grip on the scrum early on and never really regained it. The absence of Andrew Porter and RÃ³nan Kelleher was keenly felt. Sexton himself gave away a sloppy offside penalty by standing in front of the kicker. Ireland went into the half-time break 15-9 up, but still it felt like a battering, a retreat, a job made far harder than it needed to be. Sexton did grow into the game a little as it went on. There was one artful little kick over the top for Andrew Conway to chase, some sharp passes to set up Irelandâ€™s trademark round-the-corner attacks. Then of course, thereâ€™s the stuff few of us see: the little directions and asides, the words of encouragement, the messages and maxims that will have been hammered home in a thousand team meetings. Sexton is on that rarefied plane of athlete where even his mere presence can feel quietly decisive. Certainly Ireland fans are entitled to wonder how differently this championship might have gone had he been fit in Paris. Even his late withdrawal, it turned out, had tactical rather than nostalgic motives. Afterwards Sexton explained that his 80th-minute curtain call was not some mawkish milking of applause, but a sly slice of gamesmanship. â€œI was walking off to try and drag some time out at the end of the game,â€<9d> he said. â€œIt [being my final game at Twickenham] wasnâ€™t something that crossed my mind.â€<9d> And of course, any win at Twickenham is worth celebrating in its own right. Perhaps the fact that Ireland were able to win with their captain such a peripheral figure can be a source of encouragement. Perhaps, by contrast, it was a foretaste of a colder future. What happens when your big-game player fails to have a big game? What happens when a team is cast so thoroughly in one manâ€™s image that it becomes hard to envisage life without him? The one consolation for Ireland is that theyâ€™ll have plenty of time to work it out.",FALSE,"pillar/sport","Sport"

About 100 staff were invited by the PMâ€™s principal private secretary to bring a bottle and â€œmake the most of the lovely weatherâ€<9d>. But Johnson has declined to say whether he attended the event. These are just some of the responses from MPs to the furore. Johnny Mercer, MP for Plymouth Moor View: Itâ€™s humiliating, and does not reflect the majority of my colleagues who at least try and lead by example. Dr Neil Hudson, MP for Penrith and the Border: I am appalled and shocked at the reports of further gatherings in May last year that are now coming to light this week â€¦ It is vital, if we are to maintain public trust, that government employees, politicians and officials follow the same rules as the rest of the country. Christian Wakeford, MP for Bury South: How do you defend the indefensible? You canâ€™t! Itâ€™s embarrassing and whatâ€™s worse is it further erodes trust in politics when itâ€™s already low. We need openness, trust and honesty in our politics now more than ever and that starts from the top. Caroline Nokes, MP for Romsey and Southampton North and chair of the women and equalities select committee: I have no words that can adequately express how angry I am at the â€˜donâ€™t do as I do, do as I sayâ€™ attitude that appears to have prevailed in Downing Street. Mark Harper, MP for Forest of Dean and chair of the Covid Recovery Group: These are serious allegations. The prime minister will be in the House of Commons [on Wednesday] â€¦ and I await his explanation with interest. Douglas Ross, the leader of the Conservatives in Scotland: Iâ€™m in no doubt that any member â€“ whether the PM or otherwise â€“ who deliberately misleads parliament cannot continue. They would have to resign. Philip Davies, the MP for Shipley: It is clearly unacceptable for anyone in government to be flouting the laws that they had imposed on everyone else. For some of the people who imposed those damaging laws to have been ignoring them will be a bitter pill to swallow for those who faithfully followed them even at huge personal cost, and is impossible to justify and defend.â€<9d> (Bradford Telegraph and Argus) Robbie Moore, MP for Keighley and Ilkley: I am deeply angered by the thought of any illegal gatherings, parties or social events which took place at Downing Street whilst the rest of the country was in lockdown and following the rules â€¦ If any event took place that was in breach of the rules, the strongest disciplinary action must be taken, and I will continue to follow any revelations on this closely.â€<9d> Laura Farris, MP for Newbury, told BBC Politics live she â€œwould have declinedâ€<9d> any such invitation to a party: The rules were clear and unequivocal at that point in time.

I am clear that those who set the rules must abide by them or face the consequences.â€<9d> Andrew Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire: If the PM has misled parliament, itâ€™s an extremely serious matter and that, coupled with other investigations that have arisen, places the PM in an untenable situation.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

So did frenemies old and new. But is it goodbye, Ruby Shelby? Hereâ€™s your breakdown of Black Shirt. Like father, like daughter She was having visions of the devil last week. Happily, as doting dad Thomas Shelby (Cillian Murphy) arrived home from his transatlantic business trip, daughter Ruby (Orla McDonagh, who also appears in Kenneth Branaghâ€™s Belfast) had recovered. Tommy took her straight for a checkup by Dr Robert (not that one). She got the all-clear. Credit that black Madonna magic. Instead, it was Tommy who needed a doctor. He was sleepless with worry and threw up again. Ever more detached, according to Lizzie (Natasha Oâ€™Keeffe), he was â€œspeaking like youâ€™re watching everything on a screenâ€<9d>. She later found him convulsing on the bathroom floor, flashing back to the first man he ever killed, a Prussian cavalryman in the French trenches. Evidence that heâ€™s still fighting the war in his head. He suffered a similar seizure on the steamer from the US, then another in Westminster. Could it be his health, rather than another person, that defeats him? Before the credits rolled, Ruby had a worrying relapse. Her drawings looked disturbed and she heard voices coming from the chimney â€“ except it wasnâ€™t Santa. â€œThe grey man is coming for me and daddy,â€<9d> she told a terrified Lizzie. Is a Gypsy curse at play? Is she possessed by the spirit of Aunt Polly (Helen McCrory)? Did last weekâ€™s â€œgreen-eyed manâ€<9d> represent Oswald Mosley (Sam Claflin), the ghost of Tommyâ€™s Prussian foe or envious cousin Michael (Finn Cole)? More practically, was it tuberculosis? After all, Ruby was feverish and coughing up blood. Desperate times called for long-lost in-laws. Tommy summoned Esme Shelby (Aimee-Ffion Edwards), Gypsy widow of his murdered brother John (Joe Cole, now scheduled against his former cast-mates in The Ipcress File on ITV). Last seen at Johnâ€™s funeral in series four, Esme always said the Shelbys were cursed. Can she help lift it? Either way, itâ€™ll be fun to meet the firecracker again. â€˜Opium and presidents? Fuckâ€™ Heâ€™s not just an import/export mogul and menswear icon. Tommy is also, of course, MP for Birmingham South. We saw him in parliament, putting forward a radical public housing bill while Mosley and Winston Churchill (Neil Maskell), in his backbench â€œwilderness yearsâ€<9d>, looked on approvingly. First, though, Tommy gave a rousing speech to the local Labour party, insisting that his comrades wonâ€™t be silenced by Westminster about wealth inequality. In the admiring audience was IRA contact Captain Swing (Charlene McKenna, who is increasingly resembling a member of La RÃ©sistance from â€™Allo â€™Allo!) â€“ or Laura McKee, to use her real name. Tommy had been doing his homework. Over glasses of water in the Garrison â€“ it was â€œfour years, one month and six daysâ€<9d> since Tommyâ€™s last drink, not that he was counting â€“ he laid out his proposal. American east coast crime kingpin Jack Nelson was en route to London, ostensibly to secure liquor licences but really on a fact-finding mission, gauging support for fascism on behalf of the new US president, Franklin D Roosevelt. Tommy and McKee would play along, meeting â€œUncle Jackâ€<9d> at the idealistic intersection of socialism and nationalism. Tommy would arrange access to Mosley and other high-society Nazi sympathisers. Sheâ€™d promise him the support of Dublin. In return, Nelson would let them ship opium into Boston. What could possibly go wrong? Quite a lot, as sister Ada (Sophie Rundle) said: â€œYouâ€™re still looking for trouble big enough to kill you.â€<9d> Tommy might do well to listen to his smartest sibling. Whatâ€™s it all about, Alfie? Descending in an Angel Heart-like lift, shot through a red filter â€“ the hell metaphors were hardly subtle â€“ Tommy visited an old ally in the cellars beneath Camden Town. Alfie Solomons (Tom Hardy) was listening to â€œfat people shoutingâ€<9d> and planning the final act of his own operatic life. He might have become reclusive, but he still had a taste for scenery-chewing. First Tommy appealed to Alfieâ€™s lust for vengeance by reminding him that his uncle Charles had been shot by rival gangsters in east Boston. He followed up with an offer to sell his opium to the cityâ€™s Jewish mob, tipping the balance of power back towards the Solomons family. Tommy was playing a dangerous double-crossing game. He canâ€™t peddle his powdery wares to both sides of the Boston divide. Can he? Mosley and Mitford meant double trouble As we met Mosley for the first time this series, he was fine-tuning the podium lighting for his fascist rally. The British Union of Fascists leader was now joined at the hip with his very own Lady Macbeth: future wife Diana Mitford (Amber Anderson), styling herself as â€œOswaldâ€™s most recent and last ever mistressâ€<9d>. While protests raged outside, the couple schmoozed the Shelbys backstage, with several mentions of â€œour friend in Berlinâ€<9d>. Lady Di rattled Lizzie with her patronising barbs, like an aristocratic Mean Girl. Lizzie bit back by pointing out that sheâ€™d â€œfucked your future husbandâ€<9d>. I donâ€™t predict a firm friendship. Still, Mosley agreed to meet Nelson. Eyes on the prize, â€œElizabethâ€<9d>. Arthur sent to Peaky Priory Bad Santa fell off the sleigh again. Errant enforcer Arthur (Paul Anderson) got high on the Shelbysâ€™ supply and was found in an alleyway with a needle hanging out of his arm. Just say no, kids. When Arthur made a shouty display of himself at Mosleyâ€™s rally, Tommy stepped in at last. He slapped some sense into his big brother and dangled a marital carrot. Heâ€™d tracked down Arthurâ€™s estranged wife, Linda (Kate Phillips), and written asking for her â€œChristian forgivenessâ€<9d>. If Arthur stayed clean, heâ€™d contact Linda again. It seemed to do the trick. The siblings celebrated in the traditional way â€“ by brutally beating up a posse of Mosleyâ€™s blackshirts. Arthurâ€™s return to match fitness will be welcome. Heâ€™s wasted being wasted. Uncle Jack was no regular Joe Where better for two â€œworking-class Catholic boysâ€<9d> to rendezvous than church? We were finally introduced to Boston-Irish mob boss Jack Nelson (James Frecheville). Unlike many of Tommyâ€™s cartoonish frenemies, Australian actor Frecheville played Jack with understated, smoothly sinister charm. The scene was shot in Liverpool Cathedral â€“ actually an Anglican church but Britainâ€™s biggest religious building, trivia fans. Nelson might be a fictional character but writer Steven Knight had clearly taken inspiration from Joseph P Kennedy Sr. The father of JFK, Ted and Bobby also imported Scotch whisky to the US post-prohibition, was an influential FDR ally, an antisemite and travelled here so regularly that he later became US ambassador to the UK. Once again, Tommy did his sales pitch. In exchange for access to Bostonâ€™s south side, heâ€™d not only introduce Nelson to influential â€œlike mindsâ€<9d> but offer insider intel on Churchillâ€™s anti-fascist strategies. If not, Tommy would sell his opium to the Jews. Political operator Nelson agreed to think about it. Just time for London-bound niece Gina (Anya Taylor-Joy) to get in his ear. Line of the week I enjoyed Tommy drily noting: â€œMoral Turpitude is a good name for a racehorse.â€<9d> However, the prize goes to his summation of Aunt Pollyâ€™s politics: â€œBeneath all the gold and diamonds, mink and lace, she was a solid socialist.â€<9d> What, no champagne? Anachronistic soundtrack-spotting Alfie was listening to Pucciniâ€™s aria Nessun Dorma (a nod to Tommyâ€™s insomnia?), while Mosley arrived to Death From Aboveâ€™s aptly titled DieMonsterDie. We also got this seriesâ€™ first airing of Nick Caveâ€™s theme song over the closing credits. Thereâ€™s a gathering storm all right. Notes and observations An amusing cameo from Arthurâ€™s longsuffering babysitter Johnny Dogs (Packy Lee) with his eye-rolling mantra â€œFor fockâ€™s sakeâ€<9d>. James Frecheville is best known as Joshua â€œJâ€<9d> Cody in Aussie gangster flick Animal Kingdom. In the TV version, the same character is portrayed by Finn Cole â€“ yep, Peakyâ€™s own Michael Gray. Still no sign of Stephen Grahamâ€™s mysterious new Liverpudlian character. Come â€˜ed, lad.

He then told the counsellor: â€œIâ€™m not the one who has a problem.â€<9d> The Queensland coronerâ€™s court is holding an inquest into the deaths of Clarke and her children â€“ Aaliyah, 6, Laianah, 4, and Trey, 3. The inquest was told Rowan Baxter â€“ the estranged partner of Clarke and the father of the three children â€“ murdered the entire family and killed himself by setting their car alight in the Brisbane suburb of Camp Hill on the morning of 19 February 2020. In her opening remarks on Monday, counsel assisting the deputy state coroner, Jacoba Brasch, told the court that video footage showed Baxter visiting a local hardware store in the days before. He walked down the aisles looking at mower fuels and ultimately bought a jerry can, zip ties and a surface cleaner. That afternoon, Baxter made two separate phone calls to services that offer menâ€™s behaviour programs. Brasch said the inquest would next week be played â€œchilling audioâ€<9d> of Baxterâ€™s call to one of those services, in which he claimed he did not have a problem. â€œSixteen hours later, he did the unthinkable,â€<9d> Brasch said on the opening day of the inquest. The deaths of Clarke and her children brought significant public attention to the use of coercive control by domestic abusers. Queensland is considering making coercive control a criminal offence. The first witness at the inquest was a Camp Hill resident, Michael Zemek, who was washing his car outside his home on the morning of 19 February 2020. â€œI heard screaming, a hysterical scream,â€<9d> Zemek told the inquest. â€œVery quickly this car had pulled up its front right wheel basically on the driveway. And Hannah was â€¦ essentially screaming out â€˜call the police, call the police, heâ€™s trying to kill me, heâ€™s put petrol on meâ€™. â€œBaxter had his hand around her in quite a bear hug, both arms around her. He was sitting in the front seats. â€œHis demeanour was controlled. He didnâ€™t appear to be really crazy and aggressive and trying to do anything like punching or anything like that. It was just a constraining hold. My impression was he had more of a resigned look on his face.â€<9d> Zemek approached the window as Baxter set the car alight. â€œIt just went bang, a flare just went through.

And at that point I donâ€™t know whether Hannah got out herself, thatâ€™s a blank for me. â€œWhen Hannah came out she was totally ablaze from head to toe. She was in flames.

Sound waves from the regular rush-hour thrum of cities usually penetrate more than a kilometre below the Earthâ€™s surface. When Covid-19 forced humans inside, seismologists noticed the muzak of their subterranean instruments was quieted. The ancient rock of our planet came closer to the silence that it had known for nearly all of the first 4bn years of its existence. And the relative stillness was felt on the surface, too. People noticed voices from beyond the human world a little more readily, and those voices felt less need to shout to be heard. Scientists in San Francisco discovered that the cityâ€™s sparrows reverted to softer and lower pitched songs of a kind not heard since the invention of the freeway. Biology professor David George Haskellâ€™s often wonderful book is all about listening to those kinds of lost frequencies. It is a sort of rigorous scientific update on that 1960s imperative to â€œtune in and turn onâ€<9d>: a reminder that the narrow aural spectrum on which most of us operate, and the ways in which human life is led, blocks out the planetâ€™s great, orchestral richness. Haskellâ€™s previous acclaimed book, The Forest Unseen, was a thrillingly curious investigation of the life of one square metre of ancient Tennessee woodland. This new volume gives you the experience of closing your eyes in such a space and having your senses flooded with the background cacophony. It took our sun a good while, Haskell argues, to work out the means of filling the planet with sound. Eventually it discovered the cymbal crash of life. A microphone in a muted laboratory can pick up the sounds of colonies of bacteria. When these are amplified and played back to the bacterial cultures they grow at an accelerated rate, detecting the noise through cell walls. No one knows how or why. Bacteria had this ultimate chill-out playlist to itself for nearly 2bn years. The first sea creatures were voiceless. The evolutionary quirk that set life on the road to hearing was a â€œtiny wiggly hairâ€<9d>, a cilium on a cell membrane that allowed organisms to â€œhearâ€<9d> eddies and changes in water flow that might help them to locate food. Haskell traces, beautifully and brilliantly, the stages from that development to the wonders of human and animal hearing â€“ all the infinite serial interactions between communication and reception. â€œWhen we marvel at springtime birdsong, or the vigour of chorusing insects and frogs on a summer evening,â€<9d> he writes, â€œwe are immersed in the wondrous legacy of the ciliary hair.â€<9d> Crickets and their ancient relatives were among the prime movers in this evolutionary soundscape. In immersing himself in the mechanics and music of insect song, Haskell transports his reader to imagine the first instruments and notation: he examines the fossil tracery of prototype grasshopper wings, preserved in Permian rock, which clearly reveal the shift from a flat surface to one with an unusual ridge, the gene genie mutation that allowed the insect to create and amplify its sawing sound. Such discoveries lead Haskell to all sorts of places: the development of echolocation, the â€œhearing feetâ€<9d> of certain species, the insatiable human need to recreate and delight in Calibanâ€™s isle â€œfull of noisesâ€<9d>, and the ways in which technology â€“ from antler-horn pipes to reed instruments to digital soundtracks â€“ has often advanced in creating through rhythm and music. The earliest ears of all species were on high alert for novelty â€“ just like teenagers hungry for the newest beats. Some corners of the animal world are richer with this kind of innovation than others. Humpback whales, Haskell writes, concentrate their hit factory in â€œan innovation zoneâ€<9d> off the coast of Australia, where new calls are developed and tested. Once established, the latest humpback songs will have spread throughout the oceans within a few months. Tragically, evidence suggests, this natural wonder has met with brutal interference in recent years: the calls of whales and dolphins can get lost in the â€œsonic fogâ€<9d> produced by container shipsâ€™ engines. Mating and distress calls go unheard. And oil prospectorsâ€™ sonic surveys, producing underwater decibel explosions every minute, are thought to have forced whales â€“ enormously sensitive hearing creatures â€“ out of the ocean to escape the torture. Human noise pollution is everywhere on land and Haskellâ€™s investigation into natural sound often takes on the tone of a valedictory lament. He goes in search of wild places â€“ forests at dawn, riverbanks at evening â€“ where the diversity of bird and insect noise is at its overwhelming richest, and contrasts them with the eerie silent springs of pesticide-scoured agrarian landscapes. The ambition to tell the history of our planet through description of sound is given a profound urgency by these chapters. Meanwhile, the sense of what is being lost is revealed in how even the thesaurus of Haskellâ€™s descriptive language struggles to keep up with the nuance and variety of the musical world. You often sense him, as he attempts to convey in words what he is hearing, in the position of Keats: no match for the nightingale. â€¢ Sounds Wild and Broken by David George Haskell is published by Faber (Â£20).

The independent MP for Shepparton, a rural electorate of almost 50,000 people in northern Victoria, asks for a non-government business program to be reinstated in the stateâ€™s lower house. Each week, leave to debate Sheedâ€™s motion is refused. But she always brings a speech with her in the hope that, one day, the government will let her speak on the matter. Non-government business refers to the time allocated to backbenchers, opposition members, minor parties and independents. It allows them to introduce their own bills, move motions, demand production of documents by the government and refer an issue for inquiry. Victoriaâ€™s legislative assembly is the only lower house in Australia where this doesnâ€™t occur. â€œItâ€™s created a situation where the lower house is just this sort of odd place where the government dominates,â€<9d> Sheed tells Guardian Australia. â€œOur opportunities to do anything significant are terribly limited and we donâ€™t get to hold them to account in the way that they do in the upper house.â€<9d> Changes to the standing orders made by the Bracks government between 1999 and 2004 effectively eliminated non-government business in Victoria. The leader of the house, Jacinta Allan, says there has been a range of measures introduced to increase the involvement of non-government MPs. â€œWhether itâ€™s abolishing â€˜Dorothy Dixersâ€™, adding supplementary and constituency questions, or e-petitions, weâ€™ve put in a range of measures to ensure more voices in our parliament,â€<9d> Allan says. â€œWe will continue to look at other ways we can increase this going forward.â€<9d> But Sheed says the only real opportunities she gets to speak out are under mechanisms shared between government and non-government members. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sheedâ€™s electorate borders the Murray River. On the other side the river is the New South Wales independent MP for Murray, Helen Dalton. Since she entered parliament in 2019, Dalton â€“ formerly of the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party â€“ has campaigned strongly for the establishment of a public register listing all water owners in the state. She has introduced two private memberâ€™s bills on the matter, and is planning a third. â€œI wouldnâ€™t have achieved as much as what Iâ€™ve done if we werenâ€™t able to introduce private membersâ€™ bills,â€<9d> Dalton says. â€œThatâ€™s not saying itâ€™s easy. My first bill lapsed after six months because the government managed to stonewall or delay or filibuster until it lapsed. â€œBut it started a conversation.â€<9d> Dalton describes the situation in Victoria as â€œappallingâ€<9d>. â€œI really do feel for them because thereâ€™s a lot of crossbenchers and independents â€“ and weâ€™re going to continue to see more and more of us â€“ so that has to change,â€<9d> she said. In Victoriaâ€™s upper house, Reason party MP Fiona Patten has successfully lobbied the state government to introduce a supervised injecting room in Richmond, the enactment of the nationâ€™s first voluntary assisted dying laws and the decriminalisation of sex work. â€œFiona Patten has been able to create so much change, not through her own bill passing but by raising awareness of an issue the government will often pick up,â€<9d> Sheed says. â€œYet in our [lower] house, I represent an electorate of about 45,000 people who vote and thereâ€™s a lot of issues that they would like for me to address. It just really disappoints me that we canâ€™t debate some of them.â€<9d> Non-government MPs in the lower house rarely get the opportunity to debate government bills either. Since 1993, the Legislative Assembly has set a government-business program for each sitting week. When the time falls for completion of the program, debate is interrupted and members are asked to vote on outstanding matters set out in the program. Itâ€™s known as the â€œguillotineâ€<9d>. Ellen Sandell, the Greens MP for Melbourne, says the government has used this to avoid scrutiny on its bills. â€œItâ€™s incredibly bad for our democracy and pretty poor form from a Labor government to shut down any debate, questions, scrutiny, transparency. It happens every single Thursday,â€<9d> Sandell says. â€œThe crossbenchers and opposition often will ask, on specific bills, if we can just do the proper deep dive. And they always say no.â€<9d> Not one bill has gone to consideration in detail in this parliamentary term, meaning MPs have not been able to move amendments on a bill or debate its clauses in detail. Sheed says it is â€œincredibly frustratingâ€<9d> MPs were unable to put questions to the health minister, Martin Foley, during debate on the pandemic legislation last year. The oppositionâ€™s spokesperson for government scrutiny, Louise Staley, agrees. â€œAll the main ministers are in the lower house â€“ the health minister, the treasurer, the transport infrastructure minister, the premier â€“ and weâ€™re in a situation where we cannot put questions to them on legislation,â€<9d> she says. â€œItâ€™s not something that we would do all the time, on each and every bill, but some are incredibly important. â€œItâ€™s an issue that goes to the very heart of democracy.â€<9d> The Centre for Public Integrity has released a discussion paper titled â€œScrutiny shortcomings: Victoriaâ€<9d>, which raises concerns about the government businesses program and lack of non-government business in the lower house, along with the rules relating to the establishment of joint investigatory committees. â€œThese deficiencies gravely impair the ability of the parliament to perform its constitutional role, and should be addressed as a matter of priority,â€<9d> it says. The thinktank said the weakness of Victoriaâ€™s parliamentary scrutiny system was exposed by the Covid-19 response throughout 2020 and 2021, when the government failed to table health directions in parliament. The Labor-led Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations Committee found it had no power to review the directions as they werenâ€™t tabled in parliament. Both Sheed and Sandell have raised their concerns with the government but believe there is no appetite for change. â€œThereâ€™s a sense in which I think neither party wants it because they like it when theyâ€™re in government having this amount of power and not having to put up with all the â€˜nonsenseâ€™,â€<9d> Sheed says. â€œLook at the upper house â€“ itâ€™s hard work for the government. But you know, we got a much better pandemic bill out of it, so thatâ€™s democracy at work.â€<9d> Sandell says even those who support the Labor government should be worried. â€œThese things have been eroded under a Labor government, but it could be a very rightwing government that comes in next, and theyâ€™ll take advantage of all these things that have been eroded,â€<9d> she says. Opposition leader Matthew Guy says he would be happy to bring back non-government business if elected at the 26 November poll. â€œEvery member of parliament, whether theyâ€™re Liberal, Labor, National, independent or Green, they have a right to raise issues and have them debated for a period of time in the parliament. Because thatâ€™s what the parliament exists for,â€<9d> he says.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

It is true that Brexit doesnâ€™t prevent the prime minister taking an active role in supporting Ukraine against Kremlin aggression. British military hardware is appreciated on the frontline. Mr Johnson can be in the loop of western diplomacy without a seat at the EU table. He will also be attending a Nato summit in Brussels on Thursday. In the Brexiter view, UK interests in Europe can be managed through the North Atlantic alliance and bilateral conversations with continental leaders. If that were true, and the EU were a strategic sideshow, Joe Biden would not be attending both summits in Brussels. But the US president recognises something that Mr Johnson denies â€“ the European Council is a place where decisions of consequence are made. The prime minister would serve his countryâ€™s interests better from inside the room. The outbreak of war had raised hopes that the bombast and pettiness that has too often coloured British debate about the relationship with continental neighbours might be set aside. That hope was dashed when Mr Johnson made a speech last week drawing a grotesque comparison between Ukrainian resistance to the Russian invasion and the UKâ€™s decision to leave the EU. Both reflected a common appetite for liberty, the prime minister said, mining a depth of crass cynicism to which even staunch critics did not think him capable of sinking. The trivialising thrust of the analogy was made all the more insulting in the context of Ukrainian ambitions to join the very European project that Mr Johnson casts as an imperial aggressor. For Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the EU and Nato are twin pillars of a democratic European order that stands in opposition to the worldview advanced by Vladimir Putin, where the rule of law is meaningless, might is right and borders are erased at a dictatorâ€™s whim. The concept of Europe as a democratic bastion was understood by countries of the former Warsaw Pact that sought Nato and EU membership as a package in the early 2000s. It is also understood by Mr Putin, who sees undermining EU solidarity as instrumental to the goal of sabotaging western interests. That is why he backed Brexit. That EU solidarity, resolute at the start of the war, is under strain. There are differences over the shape and pace of new sanctions against Moscow and how to meet the cost. The Baltic states and Poland, having more experience of Kremlin hostility, are hawkish in wanting to maximise pressure on Moscow. Germany resists embargos that might weaken European economies by limiting energy supplies and stoking prices. This weekâ€™s summit is likely to produce only conditional statements of tougher intent, not tougher action, disappointing those who would push harder against the Putin regime. That is a debate in which Britain would like a say. As one of the continentâ€™s economic and military powers, it also has sway. Mr Johnson can be influential from outside a Brussels summit, but he has forfeited a say over the agenda. He has no one but himself to blame if decisions are made that he would have opposed had he been at the table.",FALSE,"pillar/opinion","Opinion"

Irelandâ€™s captain and metronomic fly-half has signed a contract that will see him retire after next yearâ€™s World Cup in France. By then he will be 38 but his desire to rectify his countryâ€™s poor record in the tournament is driving him on. â€œIâ€™m very grateful for the career Iâ€™ve had but you do look back and go: â€˜We gave up chances at World Cups and didnâ€™t perform at World Cups,â€™â€<9d> said Sexton, who has represented Ireland at the 2011, 2015 and 2019 editions. â€œI want to put that right. â€œIâ€™m still very driven to get there and perform in a World Cup. Iâ€™ve spoken to a lot of guys that have finished in the game and they have big regrets over World Cups.â€<9d> Having played 103 Tests for Ireland and six for the British &amp; Irish Lions across two tours, Sexton is conscious of the need to monitor his physical and mental well-being, while also maintaining a high standard on the pitch. He said the thought of missing out on a final World Cup haunted him, and he took heed from the examples of John Hayes and Gordon Dâ€™Arcy, two senior Irish players who were dropped before the 2011 and 2015 World Cups respectively. â€œItâ€™s up to me to keep my body in good shape,â€<9d> he said, referencing the prolonged careers of Brian Oâ€™Driscoll, Paul Oâ€™Connell, Peter Stringer and New Zealandâ€™s Richie McCaw as inspirations. â€œItâ€™s not like Iâ€™m the first person to do it.â€<9d> Ireland have yet to progress beyond the quarter-finals from nine World Cups. Having lifted three Six Nations titles, including a grand slam, Sexton said the opportunity to propel his nation to a place itâ€™s never been before is what motivated his decision. â€œI can still contribute and I want to,â€<9d> he said. â€œIâ€™m still very hungry to stay in the international setup. I donâ€™t want to go out with a whimper. I want to go out on top.â€<9d> That fairytale ending, though, is a blip on the horizon. Sexton said it was â€œstrange talking about the next 18 months in the week of an England gameâ€<9d>, suggesting he should have held back the news of his contract for a couple of weeks. To England then, and a trip to Twickenham for Sextonâ€™s 15th match against the Red Rose. He has won two of his five previous trips â€“ 20-16 in his third Test in 2010 and again in 2018 when Ireland secured their grand slam with a 24-15 win. Sexton has kicked 36 of his 946 Test points at Englandâ€™s home of rugby and he knows that every one of them were hard earned. â€œItâ€™s such a tough place to go to,â€<9d> he said. â€œThink about how hard we are to beat at the Aviva. [Winning away from home] is such a hard thing to do in international rugby. We have to learn lessons from the French game [which Ireland lost 30-24 in Paris last month], put them into practice and get better.â€<9d> Eddie Jones has labelled Ireland as favourites but Sexton dismissed the England coachâ€™s comments, calling them â€œirrelevantâ€<9d>. He said: â€œTheyâ€™ve been talking us up a bit. We know why theyâ€™ve been doing that.â€<9d> Not to be outdone, Sexton was gushing in his praise of the opposition. He lauded their physicality and direct approach but reserved special praise for his opposite number. â€œHeâ€™s got it all,â€<9d> he said of Marcus Smith who was 10 when Sexton made his Test debut in 2009. â€œTo win the Premiership, to get his first English cap, to go on a Lions tour. Heâ€™s ticking a lot of boxes already. Heâ€™s got the world at his feet, itâ€™s how he keeps those feet on the ground. Heâ€™s shown all the tricks â€“ short kicking game, good passing game, good running game. Heâ€™s going to be a big player over the next 10, 12 years for England.â€<9d> Reciprocal admiration has travelled in the opposite direction across the Irish Sea. Joe Marler said Sexton was â€œin the top three most competitive blokesâ€<9d> he had come across in rugby and the â€œstandards he demands are astronomicalâ€<9d>. As much as anything else, it could be the fear of what comes next that keeps Sexton moving. â€œWhen I hang up the boots Iâ€™ll be like a lost puppy for the first while.â€<9d> A World Cup winnersâ€™ medal would surely ease his anxiety.",FALSE,"pillar/sport","Sport"

Outside his native Switzerland at least, his music is heard far less often than it deserves to be, but the baritone Christian Gerhaher at least seems determined to promote its cause; in 2009 he released a recording of Schoeckâ€™s Notturno for voice and string quartet, and now he has turned his attention to Elegie, a collection of settings of poems by Eichendorff and Lenau, which was completed in 1922. It was the first of Schoeckâ€™s song cycles with ensemble, using a group of 15 instruments that includes piano, timpani and a tam-tam, from which he extracts some striking textures and colours. Though at this time Schoeckâ€™s music was still rooted in the late Romanticism of Brahms and his teacher Reger, it clearly shows his awareness of the expressionism of the Second Viennese School â€“ with occasional echoes even of Schoenbergâ€™s Pierrot Lunaire â€“ though it was only in his later works that he would explore around the fringes of that musical world more consistently. There is no narrative thread running through the 24 songs that make up Elegie; instead the pervading quiet melancholy of the settings, and the generally dark-hued instrumental writing that surrounds them, bind the whole cycle together. For Gerhaherâ€™s recording with the Basel Chamber Orchestra the string lines appear to have been considerably reinforced â€“ the score specifies seven players, whereas the booklet lists 18 â€“ though Heinz Holligerâ€™s conducting matches and balances the voice and the ensemble very precisely, and many of the most telling moments often twin the baritone with just a solo instrumental line. The vocal writing is wide-ranging, and there are moments when the lines do go rather low for Gerhaherâ€™s comfort, and then his phrases sometimes lose their usual immaculate definition and sense of shape. Otherwise, though, his performance is wonderfully careful and caring, with the baritone savouring and colouring every word as precisely as you would expect from him, in a perfect collaboration with Holliger, who as a conductor has always been fascinated by composers who donâ€™t fall into comfortable historical hierarchies. Elegie may not be as startlingly original as some of Schoeckâ€™s later works, but it is still a remarkable score, brooding and at times rather intimidating, and well worth exploring nevertheless.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

Set on a riotous St Georgeâ€™s Day in a Wiltshire village, the day the functionaries of Kennet and Avon council have chosen to evict the defiant â€œRoosterâ€<9d> Byron from his illegal encampment, the play still pulsates with a punkish, Puckish energy. The company, less white as a group than in 2009, is still seamless; Mark Rylance still mesmerising. It remains one of the most brilliant things Iâ€™ve seen at the theatre. Butterworth has recently disavowed the notion of having created a â€œstate of the nationâ€<9d> play â€“ which would anyway be a remarkably pompous thing to set out to do. That doesnâ€™t mean he didnâ€™t actually write one. What are artists for if not to sense vibrations undetectable by others? Great artists are the nationâ€™s diviners and soothsayers. Currents rise through them, poetically, obliquely, while they are telling themselves they are dealing with the practical craft of making a workable script. Butterworth has boiled Jerusalem down to being a play â€œabout wanting to stay but having to goâ€<9d> â€“ and no, thatâ€™s not a veiled reference to Brexit. It is, at its most basic, about characters moving on or offstage, the most fundamental engine-work of drama since Clytemnestra persuaded Agamemnon to step on the purple tapestries at the premiere of The Oresteia in 458BCE. I remember the shock of seeing Jerusalem in 2010: the absolute jolt of a new play about rural England â€“ and you didnâ€™t hear much about â€œEnglandâ€<9d> as a cultural or political unit then. It wasnâ€™t some pleasant pastoral; it was a difficult, messed-up countryside, albeit steeped in beauty and myth. Ultz, the designer, had conjured trees, thickets, grass; a clutter of old drinks cans and rubbish. Nothing about this was â€œcoolâ€<9d>, nor was it â€œexperimentalâ€<9d>: it was a three-act play set over a single day, as a Greek might have done it, full of Falstaffian energies â€“ which admittedly are themselves the energies of the counterculture, of punk, of an anarchic Englishness, both attractive and rebarbative. My mind couldnâ€™t help flying to other darkly enchanted forests: Arden, of course, and the â€œwood near Athensâ€<9d> of A Midsummer Nightâ€™s Dream. The man was riffing with Shakespeare, with Blake. The confidence of it was jaw-dropping. Whatâ€™s difficult to remember is that for the preceding decade, while Butterworth had been holed up at home in Pewsey, Wiltshire, trying to get the play to work, the prevailing cultural tides had seemed so different. The focus had been on London and its resurgent inner city, fuelled by a rising economy. The capital â€“ and this really does seem like something from another life â€“ was full of cheap abandoned warehouses where the YBAs, still actually young, were setting up studios. I was 24 and working at CondÃ© Nast when the March 1997 edition of Vanity Fair was dumped on my desk â€“ the famous â€œLondon swingsâ€<9d> issue, with Patsy Kensit and Liam Gallagher reclining on union jack pillows. Inside, Tony Blair, two months off becoming PM, was photographed like a grinning young saint. Even at the time, though, there was a â€œthis canâ€™t lastâ€<9d> feel: the cover article made much of echoes between its own moment and â€œSwinging London 1.0â€<9d>, the dead-and-buried 1960s. I was working at The World of Interiors magazine at the time. In that venerable home of French ticking and toile de jouy, our January issue had been â€“ shockingly in its own way â€“ devoted to concrete. Thatâ€™s where the buzz was: concrete and steel, Hoxton and Shoreditch. It was Damien Hirst, Alexander McQueen, Sarah Kane, the River CafÃ©. The buzz was not in Wootton Bassett, in Devizes, in Wilcot or Potterne, the English placenames Butterworth would conjure like charms. (All Britain came to hear of Wootton Bassett, mind, it being the place to which the bodies of British soldiers killed in Afghanistan were flown.) When did things begin to shift? Itâ€™s tempting to declare that Jerusalem marked the end of the New Labour aesthetic, but thatâ€™s way too pompous. Anyway, things had gone sour long before: Iraq, the financial crisis. Lucy Prebbleâ€™s play Enron also premiered in 2009, though Jerusalem too contains a hilarious exegesis of What Went Wrong With the Economy, via a botched attempt to buy a gram of whizz. There were other artists working against the current: Jeremy Deller and Alan Kane were collecting their Folk Archive, including images of Cumberland wrestlers and Devonian tar-barrel rollers â€“ exactly the sorts who might have done a turn at the Flintock fair, the village festival in Jerusalem. â€œThe new nature writingâ€<9d> was getting going thanks to people like Kathleen Jamie and Robert Macfarlane. Foundations were being laid that would later, indirectly, give rise to artworks from Max Porterâ€™s novel Lanny to Charlotte Prodgerâ€™s film BRIDGIT and PJ Harveyâ€™s Dorset-dialect poetry collection, Orlam. It would be facile to declare Jerusalem the prophet of Brexit. That would reduce the play. Jerusalem comes out of something more fundamental: a seam of rough, sometimes unpleasant English magic that churns away beneath the surface. Itâ€™s in Geoffrey of Monmouth. Itâ€™s in Shakespeare and Blake. Itâ€™s in Jacquetta Hawkesâ€™s A Land. Itâ€™s in Alan Garner and Susan Cooper; itâ€™s in Sylvia Townsend Warnerâ€™s novel Lolly Willowes; Deller would say it was there in 90s rave culture. Perhaps, though, Jerusalem goes deeper than that, to a place well beyond â€œnationâ€<9d> or â€œmythâ€<9d>, to the secret places of the imagination â€“ where even the most rational raise spirits and commune with ghosts. â€œCome, you battalions â€¦ Come, you giants!â€<9d> Charlotte Higgins is the Guardianâ€™s chief culture writer",FALSE,"pillar/opinion","Opinion"

Female activists or rebels should not be relegated to side discussions because of their gender. And women should be able to advocate for peace without fear of reprisals. Yet in Cameroonâ€™s conflict between English-speaking separatists and the government, this is the reality for many women and girls. Coming to grips with this reality is critical to move beyond the simplistic view that itâ€™s only men who play an active role in the conflict. Women are involved as peace or political activists. Others have joined separatist militias or are key community influencers. But whatever side of the divide they are on, anglophone women in Cameroon have one thing in common: the government and separatists have largely ignored their concerns. This is a mistake. Ignoring womenâ€™s views means overlooking key constituencies and new perspectives on the conflict. Despite the deeply patriarchal nature of Cameroonâ€™s society, some women command considerable influence, especially at grassroots level and within families. Further, the different harms suffered by women require special attention from the government, separatists and international partners. The crisis in Cameroonâ€™s two English-speaking regions began in 2017 when peaceful protests aimed at preserving their distinct legal and educational systems degenerated into armed rebellion. The conflict has killed about 6,000 people and displaced more than half a million. Military operations in the regions have failed to subdue the separatists, who increasingly use improvised explosive devices and military-grade weaponry. Women and girls make up most of the displaced. Most have to fend for themselves, forced to negotiate access to basic services, housing and employment. Sexual abuse by the warring parties is rampant, with some using rape to punish women they see as supporting their opponents. But women are not just victims, and understanding their roles in the insurgency helps explain its tenacity. Maternal validation carries significant cultural weight in the English-speaking regions, and men who joined militias were often encouraged to do so by women. Women engage in combat, gather intelligence, nurse the injured or cook. Some joined the separatists for political reasons; others are seeking revenge for abuses by security forces or are coerced. Women are also active as peacemakers. Paradoxically, the patriarchal perception that women are naturally inclined to peace initially allowed women to organise undisturbed. But as their prominence grew, womenâ€™s groups successfully pressed for relief measures and the government and separatists became more intolerant of their activism. Despite the space they have managed to carve out for themselves, female activists largely remain excluded from the political debate or see their concerns relegated to the margins. It is time the government and separatists stop overlooking the role of women in the war. With the help of international partners, they should protect women from sexual violence, primarily by ending impunity for those responsible. The health ministry should also offer medical and psychological treatment to rape survivors. The government should also step up efforts to help the displaced by providing economic support and reissuing identity documents, as without them displaced women cannot get jobs, open a bank account, start a formal business or marry, and are harassed at security checkpoints. Although there is no peace process at present, women will need to be included in negotiations when the sides are ready to talk: their buy-in is critical to building sustainable peace. Women not only provide useful perspectives on the conflict, they can also serve as advocates for a political settlement. This is not wishful thinking. We have both worked for peace in Liberia and have seen first-hand how womenâ€™s empowerment can move a country toward reconciliation. In Cameroon, preparations for womenâ€™s involvement in a peace process should start now. â€¢ Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is a Nobel peace prize laureate, former president of Liberia and a member of the International Crisis Groupâ€™s board of trustees.

The first press conference to be given by Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe since her release from detention in Iran was not something to be missed. For six years, Nazanin had been a silent figure in a continuing political drama. Now we were to get a voice to put to a name and photograph. She was to be even more impressive than any of us had imagined. First, though, it was Tulip Siddiq, Nazanin and her husbandâ€™s local MP, who took centre stage. Having paid tribute to her constituents, she cut to the chase. Given it had taken the repayment of an acknowledged debt to secure Nazaninâ€™s release, what had taken the UK government so long? And why had we detained three Iranians who had come to London in 2013 to negotiate the terms of the repayment? Surely that had only encouraged Iran to think taking hostages was the only way to get its money back. Nazaninâ€™s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, just sounded pleased to be taking a back seat at last. The six years seem to have taken a harsher physical toll on him than they have on his wife. Heâ€™s aged noticeably. His hairâ€™s greyer and thinner, his face more lined and his wife joked about him having put on weight after a hunger strike. Meanwhile, Nazanin looks little changed from the grainy images of her arrest at Tehran airport in 2016. Her scars are all on the inside and are not on the table for public consumption. â€œItâ€™s nice to be retiring from campaigning,â€<9d> he said, holding on to his wifeâ€™s hand. For his own support, rather than hers. Tabloid portrayals of Nazanin as some powerless victim caught up in a story of global realpolitik have proved well wide of the mark. Sheâ€™s a strong, powerful independent woman. Someone who knows her own mind and lives life on her own terms. You can mess with her, but you canâ€™t break her. Richard went on to say he had spent much of the past six years in a state of waiting. Now he was going to have to get used to being. He ended by saying he was in awe of his wife. As were we all. Nazanin â€“ dressed in the yellow and blue of Ukraine â€“ began by thanking her family, both in the UK and Iran, before going on to say that her freedom would never be total until other detainees â€“ such as Morad Tahbaz, whose eldest daughter, Roxanne, was also at the presser â€“ were also released. Despite having promised to release Morad on furlough, the Iranians had already put him back in prison. One personâ€™s illegal detention diminishes us all. It was an expression of humanity and selflessness. Then she let rip. A very controlled fury. Icy, almost steely. We had been warned Nazanin wouldnâ€™t be making any overtly political remarks and that any such statements would be left to Richard and Siddiq. Only no one appeared to have told Nazanin. She wasnâ€™t going to settle for anything cosy and heart-warming. It wasnâ€™t her job to make the rest of the country feel better about itself. So while she loved her husband to bits, she couldnâ€™t go along with his expressions of thanks to the government. How many foreign secretaries had it taken to get her home? It had taken five when it should have been just the one. She should have been home six years ago. Her daughter had been two when she was detained. Now she was nearly eight. No one could give her back the years that had been lost. But that was as much as Nazanin was prepared to let the media see of her true feelings. The rest was for her and her family alone. She wasnâ€™t going to emote for the hell of it. She wasnâ€™t a performing seal. She was a woman with her integrity and sanity to maintain. Nazanin had spent six years practising how to compartmentalise her emotions and she wasnâ€™t about to stop now. So she declined to answer how she had coped in her darkest hours. Or what her true feelings for her captors had been. Instead, she played it straight. There had been times of despair. Many times she had been led to think her release was imminent only to be let down. So she had learned not to trust anyone or anything. It was only when she was on the plane out of Iran that she allowed herself to believe she would be reunited with her family. And no, she was not going to let herself hold a grudge. She should never have been detained but she couldnâ€™t let that destroy her efforts to rebuild a family life. To enjoy the little things, like brushing her daughter Gabriellaâ€™s hair. â€œI have tried to leave the black hole in my heart on the plane,â€<9d> she said. As for Boris Johnson, whose careless words had made her situation incomparably worse, she had never given him the satisfaction of letting him see how much damage he had done. She had known she was powerless in prison so gave little thought to politics. And when she only had 40 minutes with Gabriella, she wanted to spend the time on colouring and reading stories. Not giving in to her contempt for someone who never really gave her a second thought. Not many could show such grace under fire. With that, the press conference ended and Nazanin, Richard and Gabriella made their way out the room. After living out of a suitcase for the best part of a week, they were finally going home together for the first time in years. To get to know each other properly once more. Meanwhile, back at the foreign affairs select committee, Philip Barton, permanent secretary at the Foreign Office, was being questioned about the discrepancy between his testimony and that of a whistleblower who had said that the prime minister had prioritised the evacuation of Pen Farthing and His Pets from Afghanistan over Afghan interpreters. Nazanin might ruefully have concluded that she would have been better off being a cockapoo. That way she might have caught the Suspectâ€™s attention and been home years ago.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Emilio kept talking to me about Oliverâ€™s new Vietnam film, which he was auditioning for. He got the lead part, Chris Taylor, but then couldnâ€™t do it because of scheduling conflicts. When I auditioned, Oliver said I was â€œtoo manneredâ€<9d> and needed to do more work. So I did The Boys Next Door and Lucas â€“ and I got the part, but only if Willem Dafoe approved. I didnâ€™t meet Willem until we got to the Philippines. He ran past me in our hotel and gave me a hug. Later, Oliver came up to me and said: â€œWillem digs ya.â€<9d> Oliver dumped us in the jungle and put us through a gruelling training course. It was insane. You had to be treated according to your rank. Willem and Tom Berenger, playing two sergeants, were in command and I was an FNG â€“ a â€œfucking new guyâ€<9d>. It really felt as if I was expected to scrub latrines, which I actually ended up doing in the movie. I thought weâ€™d go out in the day then return to the hotel at night, but at sundown on the first day, there was no bus pulling up. I looked at Johnny Depp and Forest Whitaker and said: â€œI guess weâ€™re just staying here.â€<9d> It was a shock â€“ but I donâ€™t know if we could have captured the authenticity without that intense boot camp. Relationships that were forged there still exist to this day. We survived together. Everybody was tired and angry. At one point, we found a coconut grove and Forest somehow got a coconut. I can still see him now, trying to line it up with his machete. Before I could say, â€œYour thumb is too close!â€<9d> he swings and hits his thumb dead centre. He popped it into his mouth and two thick streams of blood poured out both sides. It was a â€œscream for the medicâ€<9d> moment â€“ and that was still in training camp. Oliverâ€™s easily one of the smartest people Iâ€™ve ever met but he likes to show that off. When I knew I could get a laugh out of him, and he saw that I gave him respite from his self-imposed darkness, we got along famously. I remember the scene where Kevin Dillon goes nuts in the village with some poor guy. As my character was shooting the ground and losing his mind, I could see Oliver just off camera pumping his fist, jumping up and down and wanting to scream â€œFuck yeah!â€<9d> but not ruin the take. When I wrapped, there was a coup brewing in Manila and Oliver was taking his director of photography and a camera into the streets to film it, which was madness. I got on the flight home and, as we banked over the country, I could see everything I had left behind, everything we had all experienced. I started weeping because I was just happy to be alive. Veterans thank me for finally telling their story and a lot of them have tears in their eyes. Itâ€™s their life. John C McGinley, played Sergeant Oâ€™Neill I didnâ€™t find the training that big a deal physically, but what was hard was learning how to read maps, load weapons and be in this triple canopy jungle out in the middle of frickinâ€™ nowhere. We were eating MREs â€“ Meals Ready to Eat â€“ and nobody could poop. Willem drank water from a river when there was a decomposing oxen downstream and he got medivacked, Tom dropped a knife in his fucking foot â€“ it was just all getting terribly real. And there were snakes. Two weeks earlier, we were running around New Yorkâ€™s West Village having coffee, bagels and talking about Hamlet. Now weâ€™re in the jungle with bamboo vipers. Oliver loved it, of course. After that boot camp, it took only a tiny imaginary leap to believe what we were saying. When my character said, â€œI gotta get the fuck out of hereâ€<9d>, I meant it. My mother was having a brain operation back in Pittsburgh. There was no acting. I only felt in danger once, when I almost fell out of a helicopter. It was up about 1,000ft. It was supposed to land and we would run out and past the camera. Something was going wrong on the ground, so they wanted to go to a different area. For three weeks, weâ€™d been drilled that the one thing you donâ€™t ever let go of is your weapon â€“ so as the helicopter turned, I start to fall out because I was holding it. Francesco Quinn, who played Rhah, grabbed my backpack and pulled me in. If he hadnâ€™t done that, I wouldâ€™ve fallen out. I got pretty righteous with Oliver after that. During the filmâ€™s final battle, my character hides by covering himself with a dead body. Afterwards, on a press tour, I was seeing veterans and doing self-help chats â€“ which I had no right doing. Dozens of vets would tell me they covered themselves with bodies too. They would be weeping. I was just this 26-year-old donkey, way out of my depth, but none of that was lost on me. What Oliver touched on, all of that stuff, was overwhelming.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

The Singaporean government does not disclose how many people are held on death row, though campaigners believe there are likely more than 50 men awaiting execution, the majority of whom have been convicted of drug offences. Singapore has not carried out any executions for the past two years, due to a number of pending court applications that forced the authorities to pause proceedings. However, sentences of the death penalty have continued to be handed down, even during the height of the pandemic when hearings were held over Zoom. Families fear there is now a backlog that the authorities are attempting to clear. Among the cases to be heard next week, is an appeal launched by Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam, whose execution was stayed last year pending appeal. Nagaenthran, who has an intellectual disability, was convicted of trying to smuggle 43 grams â€“ about three tablespoons â€“ of heroin into Singapore. The handling of his case provoked global outrage, with UN experts, the European Unionâ€™s delegation to Singapore, as well as multiple rights groups and billionaire Richard Branson, a critic of the death penalty, all expressing concern. Since then, other inmates â€“ Roslan bin Bakar, Pausi bin Jefridin and Rosman bin Abdullah â€“ have been scheduled for execution. These were temporarily halted, but further hearings in their case are scheduled for next week. Kirsten Han, a journalist and activist who has written extensively about Singaporeâ€™s death penalty, said families of other inmates on death row are following the proceedings anxiously. â€œHow these recent cases go is taken as an indication of whether their cases might be coming soon. They are all very worried,â€<9d> she said. Nagaenthranâ€™s sister, Sarmila Dharmalingam, who lives in Malaysia, said she will wait anxiously for a phone call on Tuesday to hear of her brotherâ€™s fate. Sarmila said her brotherâ€™s mood is unpredictable, and that for two years during the pandemic he refused to meet relatives, they suspect due to depression. â€œSometimes Nagaen will talk nicely to my brother [who is now permanently based in Singapore], and then suddenly he will switch off, [start] looking up and down. The character is different,â€<9d> she said. Sarmila last spoke to Nagaenthran three weeks ago. He asked her why she was busy campaigning and helping organise his appeal. â€œI am speechless that Nagaen was asking me these questions,â€<9d> she said. â€œI ask, â€˜Why? You donâ€™t know for what purpose I am doing this? I already informed you that I want to save your life.â€<9d> It is unclear if he understands the situation. Worldâ€™s toughest drug laws According to Hanâ€™s research, more than 50 people are on death row, including a disproportionate number of ethnic minority inmates. Singapore has some of the worldâ€™s toughest drug laws, which its government claims are the most effective deterrent against crime. Campaigners argue this is not the case. â€œStatistics from countries that have abolished the death penalty show that the absence of the death penalty has not resulted in an increase in the crimes previously subject to capital punishment,â€<9d> said Chiara Sangiorgio, death penalty adviser at Amnesty International, who pointed to data from Canada. The Singapore government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In 2012, a legal change granted Singaporean judges narrow discretion to sentence convicts to life imprisonment and possible caning if certain criteria are met. Individuals must prove they were acting only as a courier, and must obtain a certificate of substantive assistance, confirming that they had provided information that significantly helped disrupt drug trafficking activities, or prove they have a mental or intellectual disability that substantially impaired their mental responsibility. Yet inmates who appear to meet such criteria struggle to have this accepted by the courts, including Nagaenthran, whose various psychiatric conditions were not recognised. Pannir Selvam Pranthaman, who was found guilty of carrying 51.84g of heroin in 2017, was also refused such an allowance. His lawyer argued he had given information to the authorities which led to the arrest of another drug trafficker. However, the court said this information confirmed what the authorities had already known and so, while accurate, wasnâ€™t useful enough to warrant a certificate. Pannirâ€™s sister, Angelia Pranthaman, who campaigns on behalf of her brother and other death row inmates, said her brother has exhausted all forms of legal challenge. Their only option is to ask for clemency. â€œWe have no hope in clemency,â€<9d> she said, adding that no pardon has been issued for decades. â€œI am very scared of the word because that is the last option we have.â€<9d> Han said that while the public is supportive of the death penalty, it is becoming more open to discussing the issue. Recent high profile cases may, for many, be the first time they have discovered how the death penalty works, she said. Reforms though, are likely to take time, said Han, which is little comfort to the families of those awaiting execution. â€œIf someone is scheduled to hang next week I canâ€™t possibly tell his family â€“ oh, you know, change takes time and the death penalty will be abolished in 10 years, because they really donâ€™t care about that.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Thank you for reading. The Russian rouble has fallen 5.4% to a record low on Thursday, after financial markets were shaken by Vladimir Putinâ€™s decision to invade Ukraine. The Moscow Exchange said on Thursday morning it had suspended trading on all markets. Brent crude oil prices crossed $100/barrel for first time since 2014. Safe haven currencies such as the yen and US dollar rose, along with gold and other valuable commodities such as nickel and wheat. Stock markets saw heavy losses with the the Hang Seng in Hong Kong off 3.1%, the Nikkei down 2%, Seoul losing 2.7% and the ASX in Sydney closing down 3%. Big losses also coming in Europe. US president Joe Biden recently spoke with Ukraineâ€™s president Zelenskiy Volodymyr. A White House statement reads: President Zelenskiy reached out to me tonight and we just finished speaking. I condemned this unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces. I briefed him on the steps we are taking to rally international condemnation, including tonight at the United Nations Security Council. He asked me to call on the leaders of the world to speak out clearly against President Putinâ€™s flagrant aggression, and to stand with the people of Ukraine. Tomorrow, I will be meeting with the Leaders of the G7, and the United States and our Allies and partners will be imposing severe sanctions on Russia. We will continue to provide support and assistance to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.â€<9d> Reports of explosions are filtering in from Kyiv, as well as air raid sirens and rocket attacks on Ukrainian fighter jets at an airport outside the city. Russian forces fired missiles at several Ukrainian cities and landed troops on its south coast on Thursday, officials and local media report, after Russian President Vladimir Putin authorised what he called a â€œspecial military operationâ€<9d> in the east. Russian-backed separatists in Ukraineâ€™s Donetsk have launched large-scale strikes against Ukrainian forces along the line of contact, Russiaâ€™s Interfax news agency cited a separatist spokesman as saying on Thursday. Guardian reporter Luke Harding who is based in Kyiv said explosions have been reported across the country, including in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol, Dnipro, Odessa, Slavayansk and Kramatorsk. Two big blasts were reported being heard from the city of Mariupol one after another in an easterly direction, according to a Reuters witness. Ukraineâ€™s defence minister said Russia began intense shelling of Ukrainian military units in the east, as well as military control centres and airfields. A photo provided by the Ukrainian Presidentâ€™s office appeared to show an explosion in the countryâ€™s capital, Kyiv, early Thursday morning. Residents in Ukrainian cities appear to be fleeing in the wake of the Russian military attack. Here are some images on the news wires. Ukraineâ€™s foreign minister has called for more sanctions on Russia and requested military and financial assistance as well as humanitarian aid. The European Union says it will â€œhold Moscow accountableâ€<9d> for what commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said was an â€œunjustifiedâ€<9d> attack on Ukraine. â€œIn these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives,â€<9d> she said on Twitter. â€œWe will hold the Kremlin accountable,â€<9d> von der Leyen added. EU leaders will hold an emergency summit in Brussels later on Thursday. The British prime minister has responded to the Russian attack on Ukraine: The Guardianâ€™s Luke Harding is in Ukraine where president Volodymyr Zelenskiy just addressed the nation following reports from Ukrainian officials that Russian troops have landed in Odessa while others are crossing the border into Kharkiv. Ukraineâ€™s president Zelenskiy made an urgent national address this morning, introducing martial law while urging people to remain calm. In a brief video address which has since been published by the ministry of defence on Thursday morning, Zelenskiy said Russia has carried out missile strikes on Ukraine infrastructure and on Ukrainian border guards with explosions being heard in many cities across the country. He added that he spoken with US president Joe Biden, and told Ukrainians to stay home and to stay calm: â€œThe army works. I will be with you all the time. Stay strong. We will win because we are Ukraine. Glory to Ukraineâ€<9d> Zelenskiy also said Ukraine will introduce martial law on all territories of the state, Reuters reports. Ukrainian officials say Russian troops have landed in Odessa while others are crossing the border into Kharkiv. The Ukrainian interior ministry made the announcement on Telegram, adding that rocket attacks are targeting Ukrainian fighter jets at an airport outside Kyiv. Ukraineâ€™s state emergency service says attacks have been launched against 10 Ukrainian regions, primarily in the east and south of the country. At least seven â€œpowerfulâ€<9d> airstrikes on Vasilkovsky airport outside Kyiv, where Ukraineâ€™s military fighter bombers are kept, Kyiv command says Guardian senior reporter Peter Beaumont tells us if the reports coming in from around Ukraine are accurate, this is far from a being a limited operation by Russia. Instead it looks like military operations of different kinds are being launched in a broad crescent from Odessa in the south-west along the coast eastwards towards Mariupol, through to Kharkiv further north and finally Kyiv at the top of the crescent. While a lot of reported attacks so far appear to have involved missile strikes, there are unconfirmed reports now via Ifax and elsewhere of troops landing in the south and crossing the border near Kharkiv too. Ukraineâ€™s deputy interior minister, Anton Gerashchenko, has also confirmed a Russian invasion has begun. In a statement posted to his official Facebook page, the minister said: The invasion has begun. There have just been missiles on the military headquarters, airports, military warehouses, near Kyiv, Kharkiv, Dnieper. Gunfire at the border is underway. From this day, there is a new geopolitical reality in the worldâ€<9d> United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres has made a direct plea to Russian present Putin, saying: â€œIn the name of humanity bring your troops back to Russia.â€<9d> Guterres, who has served as secretary-general since 2017, added that todayâ€™s actions are the â€œsaddest moment in my tenureâ€<9d>. Ukraineâ€™s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has confirmed Russiaâ€™s â€œfull-scale invasionâ€<9d> of Ukraine. Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes. This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.â€<9d> Russiaâ€™s representative to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, has justified Russiaâ€™s military operations under article 51 of the UN charter, which allows for â€œself-defenceâ€<9d>. Nebenzya defended Russiaâ€™s decision to take military action in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine during an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council held just moments earlier. According to Reuters, Nebenzya told the United Nations security council of Putinâ€™s announcement of a special military operation in eastern Ukraine. The root of todayâ€™s crisis around Ukraine is the actions of Ukraine itself, who for many years were sabotaging its obligations.â€<9d> Nebenzya is presumably referring to the Minsk agreement. He also claimed that the Russian operation aimed to protect residents in the Russian-backed separatist regions of eastern Ukraine, â€œwho for eight years have been cowering from Ukraineâ€™s shelling.â€<9d> Nebenzya went on to say that â€œUkrainian provocation against those in Donbas not only has not stopped but has intensified,â€<9d> which he said prompted separatist leaders in the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk to request Russian assistance. Ukraineâ€™s UN ambassador responded, declaring Russian president Putin declared â€œa war on my countryâ€<9d>. The British ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, has said that a â€œwholly unprovokedâ€<9d> attack on Ukraine is under way. â€œA wholly unprovoked attack on a peaceful country is unfolding. Horrified,â€<9d> she said in a tweet on Thursday morning. â€œJust because youâ€™ve prepared and thought about this possibility for weeks and months doesnâ€™t mean it isnâ€™t shocking when it actually happens.â€<9d> US president Joe Biden has delivered a statement on Russiaâ€™s â€œunprovoked and unjustifiedâ€<9d> attack on Ukraine. A White House statement reads: The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces. President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.â€<9d> Biden said he will meet his G7 counterparts in the morning [EST] before speaking to the American people to announce the â€œfurther consequences the United States and our Allies and partners will impose on Russia for this needless act of aggressionâ€<9d> against Ukraine and global peace and security. â€œJill and I are praying for the brave and proud people of Ukraine,â€<9d> Biden added. Here is a snap from the Guardianâ€™s Peter Beaumont reporting from Lviv in western Ukraine. After a sleepless night in Ukraine in which many people here were expecting a Russian attack to begin and remained glued to their phones throughout the night, reports of explosions have begun coming in from various cities in the last few minutes. On a live broadcast from Kyiv just now CNNâ€™s Mathew Chance has described hearing 4-5 loud bangs that he could not identify. A report on Ifax also reported gunfire near Kyivâ€™s Boryspil airport, again so far unconfirmed as A Nato official told Reuters ban invasion appeared to be underway. There were also initial albeit unconfirmed details coming in of explosions being heard in Kharkiv, Kramatorsk, Kharkiv, Odesa and Mariupol. The reports follow hard on the heels of a speech by Russian president Vladimir Putin announcing that he was ordering a military operation against Ukraine â€“ declaring war on Ukraine in other words. Putin added that any foreign attempt to interfere with Russian action would lead to â€˜consequences they have never seen.â€™ Accusing the US and its allies of ignoring Russiaâ€™s demands to stop Ukraine from joining Nato and offer Moscow security guarantees Putin said the Russian military operation aimed to ensure a â€œdemilitarisationâ€<9d> and â€œde-Nazificationâ€<9d> â€“ in his words â€“ of Ukraine. Putin said Ukrainian servicemen who lay down arms will be able to safely leave the zone of combat. So far, where I am in Lviv in Ukraineâ€™s west, it remains quiet. Financial markets have been rocked by developments in Ukraine and weâ€™re seeing large falls on the major Asia Pacific indices where Thursdayâ€™s session is already underway. The Nikkei in Tokyo has dropped 1.9%, Seoul is down 2.3% and the ASX in Sydney has plunged 3%. The Hang Seng has dropped 2.82%. Bitcoin has dropped another 5.4% as riskier assets took a pounding in the wake of reports of explosions across Ukraine and Vladimir Putinâ€™s bellicose address. But safe havens such as gold, the US dollar and a range of commodities including nickel, and wheat have all spiked upwards. Multiple reports are coming in of the sounds of explosions being heard across Ukraine, this morning. â€œTwo booms heard from my apartment on Khreshatyk, Kyiv in the past 3 minutes,â€<9d> CNN reporter Neil Hauer said. Other reports of a large explosion in Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine are also filtering through. A witness in Kyiv told Reuters they also reported hearing a series of distant loud noises similar to the firing of artillery, according to the news agency. More from Putinâ€™s address: The Russian president says he wants to â€œdemilitarise and de-Nazifyâ€<9d> Ukraine Putin has also called on Ukrainian soldiers to put down their weapons and go home, according to Reuters, citing the Russian news agency Tass. The Russian president adds that â€œin case of foreign interference, Russia will act immediatelyâ€<9d>. Responsibility for bloodshed will be on the hands of the â€œUkrainian regimeâ€<9d> Russiaâ€™s response â€œwill be instant if anyone tries to take it onâ€<9d> He tells Ukrainians that â€œyour fathers and grandfathers did not fight so you could help â€˜neo-Nazisâ€™â€<9d> Vladimir Putin has announced that Russia will carry out a â€œspecial military operationâ€<9d> in Ukraine, Reuters reports. In an address to the Russian people under way now and coinciding with the United nations security council meeting, the Russian president also said: Clashes between Ukrainian and Russian forces are â€œinevitableâ€<9d> and â€œonly a question of timeâ€<9d>. Further nato expansion and its use of Ukraineâ€™s territory are unacceptable The Russian military operation aims to â€œprotect peopleâ€<9d> Circumstances â€œdemand decisive action from Russiaâ€<9d> The UKâ€™s representative Dame Barbara Woodward has wrapped up her speech now. For months, Russia has been holding a gun to Ukraineâ€™s head. Now, Putinâ€™s finger is on the trigger.â€<9d> US representative Linda Thomas-Greenfield took to the floor with an emphatic plea to Russia. We are here tonight because we believe along with Ukraine that a full-scale further invasion into Ukraine by Russia is imminent. Tonight weâ€™re seeing the Russians close airspace, move troops into Donbas and move forces into combat-ready positions. This is a perilous moment and weâ€™re here for one reason, and one reason only: to ask Russia to stop. Return to your borders. Send your troops, your tanks, and your planes back to their barracks and hangars. And send your diplomats to the negotiating table. Back away from the brink, before it is too late.â€<9d> Thomas-Greenfield added that Russia called previous US predictions â€œhystericalâ€<9d>. She added: Russia said we were lying. Russia said we were supplying the world with misinformation. But what we said would happen has come to pass, for all the world to see.â€<9d> Albaniaâ€™s representative Ferit Hoxha has called the situation a â€œsenseless madnessâ€<9d>. Ukrainians are facing another aggression just because they dare to exist. Russian wars have nothing to do with its security. This is a confrontation between Russia and international law.â€<9d> UN secretary general â<81>¦Antonio Guterres has just addressed the UN security council meeting. Guterres addressed Russian president Putin directly: If indeed an operation is being prepared I have only one thing to say. Putin stop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.â€<9d> Another emergency UN security council meeting on Ukraine is set to get underway. Russiaâ€™s UN representative Vasily Nebenzya has just told reporters: â€œIâ€™m starting to enjoy nightly meetings.â€<9d> You can follow the live coverage below: Flights of civil aircraft across Ukraine airspace have been suspended after a notice to airmen (Notam) was released. Earlier, airports in the Ukraine cities of Dnipro, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia were closed to traffic. A fuller picture of the atmosphere in Kyiv is emerging as many in the city say they are unable to sleep. â€œIt feels like almost all people I know are not sleeping,â€<9d> Kyvi Independent journalist Oleksiy Sorokin said in a Twitter post early on Thursday. â€œIt feels as if the whole country is awake this night.â€<9d> Fellow Kyiv Independent journalist Anastasiia Lapatina said: â€œSeems like hundreds, and probably thousands, of Ukrainians are awake right now. Itâ€™s 4 in the morning. Scrolling, waiting, texting. What a horrific moment.â€<9d> â€œIt feels like almost all people I know are not sleeping,â€<9d> Oleksiy Sorokin, a Kyvi-based journalist said in a Twitter post early on Thursday. â€œIt feels as if the whole country is awake this night.â€<9d> â€œKyiv is quiet right now. Not a single car on the road when I walked outside,â€<9d> foreign correspondent, Trey Yingst, added. â€œThere are millions of innocent civilians here who do not want conflict. There are no winners in war.â€<9d> Itâ€™s a busy night tonight with officials in Ukraine and in the west saying that Russia is on the brink of launching an invasion. The last few hours have seen western leaders scramble to arrange talks in a last-ditch effort to avert war in Ukraine. The United Nations security council is set to hold another emergency meeting in the coming hour to discuss Ukraine. Hereâ€™s what we know so far: The United States has said that a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine is imminent, and that Russian troops and separatist forces surrounding the country were in combat-ready positions. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said â€œeverything seems to be in placeâ€<9d> for a Russian invasion of Ukraine but still sees a chance to â€œavert a major aggressionâ€<9d>. The UN has confirmed that there will be an emergency meeting of the security council to discuss the Ukraine crisis at 9.30pm on Wednesday, New York time. That is 4.30am in Ukraine and 2.30am GMT, or around 30 minutes from now. Russia has banned civil aircraft from airspace around north-eastern Ukraine while the three Ukrainian airports of Dnipro, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia have been closed to traffic until Thursday morning, according to a recent notice to airmen. Ukrainian media are reporting at least six government websites are down in an alleged cyberattack early on Thursday morning. At least five explosions were heard in the separatist-held eastern Ukraine city of Donetsk early on Thursday morning, a Reuters witness has said. Meanwhile, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, gave a 10-minute national address to his country in the early hours of Thursday morning pleading for peace and adding that he believed Russia had approved an offensive against Ukraine. Zelenskiy vowed Ukraine would defend itself in the face of invasion and rejected Moscowâ€™s claims that his country poses a threat to Russia, lamenting that a Russian invasion would cost tens of thousands of lives. He also said Russian president Vladimir Putin had not replied to his invitation to hold talks. Reuters has just confirmed our earlier report that the three Ukrainian airports of Dnipro, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia have been closed to traffic until Thursday morning, citing a recent notice to airmen. US state department spokesperson Ned Price has issued another warning about â€œKremlin disinformation campaignsâ€<9d>. He says there is no evidence to support Ukraine is committing genocide or conducting attacks in Donetsk or Luhansk. The Kremlin continues to create false narratives to justify invasion. It is fabricating supposed Ukrainian provocations in order to evacuate civilians from parts of eastern Ukraine. Metadata from evacuation videos filmed by Russia-backed officials exposed they were filmed February 16, 2 days before the alleged attacks occurred. (February 16, not January 16) Eerie scenes from Kyiv are emerging after Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy issued a state of emergency across Ukraine. â€œThe city itself still feels calm, if a little emptier than usual. There were armoured vehicles earlier on Maidan square,â€<9d> Moscow correspondent for the Financial Times Polina Ivanova said in a tweet in the early hours of Thursday morning. US secretary of state Antony Blinken says â€œeverything seems to be in placeâ€<9d> for a Russian invasion of Ukraine but still sees a chance to â€œavert a major aggressionâ€<9d>. Speaking to NBC News he said: Everything seems to be in place for Russia to engage in a major aggression against Ukraine.â€<9d> Blinken also told ABC News that Russia is â€œputting the final touchesâ€<9d> on having forces in places for a â€œfull-on invasionâ€<9d> and said the US has â€œcertainly seen the presence of Russian forces inside of Ukraine.â€<9d> The secretary of state did not elaborate on the Russian forces he said they have seen inside Ukraine and could not give â€œspecific numbers,â€<9d> but â€œeverything weâ€™ve seen over the last 24 to 48 hours has Russia of putting the final touches on having its forces in place across all of Ukraineâ€™s borders, to the north, to the east, to the south, to be ready for a full-on invasion.â€<9d> Russia has reportedly banned civil aircraft from airspace around northeastern Ukraine while flight paths along the Ukraine Russia border are reportedly closed and runways appear to be blocked in Ukraineâ€™s airports. Ukrainian airports in Kharkiv, Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia are closed and runways are blocked in case of a possible attack, the Kyiv Independent reports, citing a report from ZN media. The airport in Kherson is to be closed next. Aviation analyst Alex Macheras said multiple airlines, including European carriers, have been informed by aviation risk management agencies that Ukraine is now considered a â€œdo not flyâ€<9d> area. According to CNN, Russia has issued a notice banning civil aircraft from flight routes bordering north-eastern Ukraine. â€œRussia issued a NOTAM (notice to airmen or notice to air missions) that covers a corridor of territory where Russian forces have gathered over the past weeks,â€<9d> the outlet reported. Stocks in Asia Pacific are being hammered on Thursday morning as the grim drumbeat of war in Ukraine becomes louder by the minute. The Australian ASX200 index was first cab off the rank and is down 2.3% after 90 minutes of trading. In Tokyo, the Nikkei average is down 0.8% and the Kospi in Seoul has fallen 1.4%. It follows steep losses on Wall Street where the Dow lost 1.4%, S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.8%, Nasdaq plunged 2.6%. The S&amp;P 500 â€“ the broadest measure of shares in the US â€“ has fallen 10% since its record high on 3 January, meaning it is officially in a correction phase. The Dow is only a fraction off the same metric. The Nasdaq has tumbled more than 16% so far this year. At least five explosions were heard in the separatist-held eastern Ukraine city of Donetsk early on Thursday morning, a Reuters witness has said. Following the blasts, four military trucks could be seen heading for the scene. Hours earlier, the Kremlin said two separatist breakaway regions in Ukraine had asked for Russian help to repel â€œaggressionâ€<9d> by the Ukrainian army. The United States has said that a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine is imminent, and that Russian troops and separatist forces surrounding the country were in combat-ready positions. Pentagon spokesperson, John F Kirby, told reporters. Russian forces continue to assemble closer to the border ... They are ready to go. They could attack at any time ... with a significant military force.â€<9d> The UN has confirmed that there will be an emergency meeting of the security council to discuss the Ukraine crisis at 9.30pm on Wednesday, New York time. That is 4.30am in Ukraine and 2.30am GMT, or around two hours from now. France is urging citizens to leave Ukraine â€œwithout delayâ€<9d> amid mounting concerns that Russia is preparing a full-scale attack. Franceâ€™s foreign ministry said the decision was made in the context of â€œserious tensions caused by the concentration of Russian troops on Ukraineâ€™s bordersâ€<9d> and and in light of the establishment of the state of emergency passed by the Ukrainian Parliament. In a statement, as reported by Agence France-Presse, the ministry said: French citizens finding themselves in Ukraine should leave the country without delay. Any travel to the border areas in the north and east of the country is strictly discouraged.â€<9d> Ukrainian media are reporting at least six government websites are down in an alleged cyberattack. â€œCyber attack also hit websites of ministries of infrastructure, strategic industries and education,â€<9d> the Kyiv Independent newspaper reports. According to the publication, the websites of the cabinet of ministers, foreign and agricultural ministries and the security service are down. The United Nations security council will hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday night to discuss Ukraine, diplomats said, after separatists in eastern Ukraine asked for Russia for help to repel â€œaggressionâ€<9d>, Reuters is reporting. The Ukrainian president said he is pleading for peace while Vladimir Putin would not accept his call. In an emotional address address, Zelenskiy rejected Moscowâ€™s claims that his country poses a threat to Russia and lamented that a Russian invasion would cost tens of thousands of lives. The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace.â€<9d> He said the people of Ukraine wanted peace, but â€œif someone attempts to take away our land, our freedom, our lives, the lives of our children, we will defend ourselvesâ€<9d>. By attacking, you will see our faces, not our backs, but our faces.â€<9d> Zelenskiy said the people of Russia were being lied to and that the possibility of war also â€œdepends on youâ€<9d>. â€œWho can stop [the war]? People. These people are among you, I am sure,â€<9d> he said. Ukraineâ€™s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has just given a 10-minute national address to his country in the early hours of Thursday morning, local time. Zelenskiy said Russia had approved an offensive against Ukraine and said Russian president Vladimir Putin had not replied to his invitation to hold talks, Reuters reports, citing the address in which he spoke in both Ukrainian and Russian. He also warned that any flare-up from Russia could â€œburn everythingâ€<9d> and create a catastrophic crisis. Speaking in Russian, he called on Russians to not believe the narratives about Ukraine being presented on Russian state television. I initiated a telephone call with the president of the Russian Federation. Result: silence. This step could be the start of a big war on the European continent. The whole world is talking about what could happen any day now. Any provocation. Any flare-up â€“ one that could burn everything.â€<9d> The address has since been posted on Telegram. Hello, itâ€™s Samantha Lock with you as my colleague Maanvi Singh signs off. French President Emmanuel Macron has reiterated his support for Ukraineâ€™s sovereignty and territorial integrity after a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the ElysÃ©e Palace said in a statement late on Wednesday. â€œ[Macron] also praised the Ukrainian Presidentâ€™s composure in the current situation,â€<9d> the French presidency said. Support that the European Union can provide to Ukraine will be on the agenda of the meeting of the European Council on Thursday, the ElysÃ©e Palace added. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Russia had not responded to his invitation to hold talks. In a national address posted on Telegram, Zelenskiy warned that any flare-up from Russian could â€œburn everythingâ€<9d> and create a catastrophic crisis. Addressing Russians directly, in their language, he said that the narratives they were being fed by Russian media were far from Ukrainiansâ€™ reality. Hereâ€™s some translation from the FTâ€™s Max Seddon: Hereâ€™s the Guardianâ€™s Luke Harding on the mood in Ukraine tonight. Ukraine is requesting a meeting of the UN security council, in response to the request by the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk for Russian military assistance. Ukrainians in the UK have called on the west to provide military aid to their homeland, ahead of a protest outside the Russian embassy in London tonight. Wolodymyr Pawluk, chair of the London branch of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, called on the west to provide both military and economic aid to help Ukrainians resist Russian forces. Pawluk, who said the AUGB has so far raised Â£50,000 towards an emergency humanitarian fund, added: â€œWe understand the Nato troops arenâ€™t going to fight on Ukrainian soil. Well, if theyâ€™re not willing to fight, send us the armour [so] that we can fight [for] ourselves.â€<9d> Other Ukrainians in the UK told the Guardian they want the west to impose much tougher sanctions on Russia. Olesya Khromeychuk, director of the Ukrainian Institute London, said: â€œSanctions, right now, donâ€™t match the strong declarations of support we heard from British politicians. The UK needs to decide: to sacrifice the Russian wealth, including that which comes in the form of donations to political parties, or be laughed at by the Kremlin and lose credibility around the world.â€<9d> Marta Mulyak, head of the London branch of Plast National Scout Organisation of Ukraine, said: â€œSeeing the west being so weak is very unsettling. The UK sanctioned five banks and three oligarchs. Itâ€™s a joke. Itâ€™s not about saving lives, itâ€™s about saving your profits.â€<9d> Ukrainian communities around the UK have also spoken about the trauma and anxiety experienced by the diaspora amid escalating Russian military action against their homeland. Wol Wowczuk, secretary of the Leicester Ukrainian Centre, said: â€œItâ€™s shock, itâ€™s horror, itâ€™s disbelief, itâ€™s anger, itâ€™s great upset. And itâ€™s not knowing whatâ€™s going to happen next.â€<9d> Petro Chymera, head of the Ukrainian Youth Association in Bradford, said: â€œWeâ€™ve seen it coming, but when it finally happens it is really shocking. That speech that Putin made on Monday has got everyone scared of the future. It was threatening the very existence of Ukraine. â€œItâ€™s really important that the west unites and stands up for Ukraine. Because we canâ€™t have any more concessions. Weâ€™re fighting for Ukraineâ€™s very existence.â€<9d> Hereâ€™s an update of whatâ€™s happened so far today: Donetsk and Luhansk asked Russia for military aid, a move many experts are calling the possible final pretext for a Russia invasion. Ukraine imposed a national state of emergency for the next 30 days. US President Joe Biden announced sanctions on the company that owns Nord Stream 2, the controversial pipeline project. Russia began evacuating its embassy in Kyiv, Ukraineâ€™s capital. Russia moved nearly 100% of troops into invasion-ready position, according to a senior US defence official. Additional reports said US intelligence warned Ukraine that an all-out attack was imminent. The UN general assembly held a meeting about the Ukraine crisis, with several member states calling for Russia to deescalate and spelling out the consequences of an invasion. More on life for Ukraine residents as a Russian invasion looms: hereâ€™s a Guardian gallery depicting Ukrainian civilians, soldiers and other aspects of life on the countryâ€™s eastern front, shot by photographer GaÃ«lle Girbes. Amid escalating aggression from Russia, parents in Ukraine have been trying to protect their children in case of a full-out attack, with some sending their kids to school wearing stickers with their blood types listed, reports NBC. The US Pentagon believes that â€œadditional Russian military forcesâ€<9d> are moving into the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, according to Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby. From CNNâ€™s Kaitlan Collins: Leaders of two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine have asked Russia for help with aggression from the Ukrainian army, reports Ifax citing Russian government spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Many experts are pointing to these requests as the latest (possibly final) pretext that Russia could use to launch a full attack on Ukraine. More on the plant in Armyansk that was evacuated: Ukraineâ€™s military intelligence has tweeted out a statement that Ukraine has not planned and will not plan any sabotage of the facility, calling such statements false. From the Ukraine military intelligence account: We officially declare that Ukraine has not planned and does not plan any act of sabotage at this facility and refutes all statements on this issue. Ukraineâ€™s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted out recently that a chemical plant in Crimea was evacuated today, saying that the move could be preparation for another staged provocation from Russia. Kuleba wrote: Worrying reports from Crimea on the entire night shift of Titan chemicals plant in Armyansk evacuated from the facility. This might be a preparation for another staged provocation by Russia. Moscow seems to have no limits in attempts to falsify pretexts for further aggression. Following the announcement of Ukraine imposing a 30-day state of emergency order, here is a video explainer from BBC on what the order means for the Ukraine crisis. Here is a further breakdown of what measures Ukraine can implement following the approval of the state of emergency order from journalist Oleksiy Sorokin: The Ukraine parliament just voted to approve a state of emergency. The state of emergency decree will begin on 24 February and last 30 days. More details to come. Several European countries, along with stationed US military, are preparing to accommodate upwards of 1 million refugees from Ukraine if Russia continues with an invasion, reports the Washington Post. From the Postâ€™s Loveday Morris: A new war on the edge of Europe has the potential to unleash the continentâ€™s biggest humanitarian crisis since the Syrian civil war triggered the arrival of more than 1 million refugees in 2015. At every level, plans are complicated by huge unknowns. Could there be a trickle of people seeking safety inside the borders of the European Union â€” or potentially millions? Polish officials have indicated that a worst-case scenario could see as many as 1 million people arriving from Ukraine in case of a full-scale Russian invasion. Hungary, which also borders Ukraine, has said it is sending troops to the border, partly in preparation for refugees. Romania has said it is considering refugee camps. But Poland, which is already home to as many as 2 million Ukrainians and shares more than 300 miles of border with the country, is expected to bear the brunt of any influx. Officials in Przemysl, a Polish city next to the border, said the city was asked on Monday whether it had space to house as many as 1,000 Americans leaving by land. As urgency has built, EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson traveled to Warsaw earlier this week, where she said Europe was â€œwell preparedâ€<9d> for an influx. But in towns along the border, some city officials donâ€™t feel the same as they work on their own to designate gym halls, schools student dorms as potential waystations. Read the full article here (paywall). An update from inside Ukraineâ€™s parliament as the language of an emergency decree issued earlier today is finalized: From Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko: The mood is sombre in the Parliament of Ukraine as MPs await the final text of the State of Emergency decree. Voting to start in several minutes. The White House has issued a statement from Joe Biden, confirming the presidentâ€™s decision to impose sanctions on Nord Stream 2: Since Russia began deploying troops to the Ukrainian border, the United States has worked closely with our allies and partners to deliver a strong, unified response. As I said when I met with Chancellor Scholz earlier this month, Germany has been a leader in that effort, and we have closely coordinated our efforts to stop the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if Russia further invaded Ukraine. Yesterday, after further close consultations between our two governments, Germany announced that it would halt certification of the pipeline. Today, I have directed my administration to impose sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG and its corporate officers. These steps are another piece of our initial tranche of sanctions in response to Russiaâ€™s actions in Ukraine. As I have made clear, we will not hesitate to take further steps if Russia continues to escalate. Through his actions, President Putin has provided the world with an overwhelming incentive to move away from Russian gas and to other forms of energy. I want to thank Chancellor Scholz for his close partnership and continued dedication to holding Russia accountable for its actions. According to my colleague Joan E Greve, Biden had previously blocked congressionally approved sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, out of concern for the relationship with Germany, but Chancellor Olaf Scholzâ€™s decision to halt the projectâ€™s certification has now cleared the way. As the west sounded the alarm about the Kremlin ordering troops into eastern Ukraine and decried it as an invasion, Russian state media painted a completely different picture - of Moscow coming to the rescue of war-torn areas tormented by Ukraineâ€™s aggression and bringing them peace, reports the Associated Press. TV presenters hailed the â€œhistoricâ€<9d> day and professed the end of suffering for the residents of the breakaway regions. â€œYou paid with your blood for these eight years of torment and anticipation,â€<9d> anchor Olga Skabeyeva told residents of the areas known as Donbas during a popular political talk show Tuesday morning on Russia 1 state TV. â€œRussia will now be defending Donbas.â€<9d> TV pundit Vladimir Solovyev echoed those sentiments on his morning show on state Vesti.FM radio. â€œWe will ensure their safety,â€<9d> he declared. â€œIt is now dangerous to fight with them because one will now have to fight with the Russian army.â€<9d> Channel One, another popular state-funded TV station, struck a more festive tone, with its correspondent in Donetsk asserting that local residents â€œsay it is the best news over the past years of war.â€<9d> â€œNow they have confidence in the future and that the years-long war will finally come to an end,â€<9d> she said. Whether Russians are buying it is another question. A Facebook campaign with the hashtag â€œIâ€™m not staying silentâ€<9d>, launched by independent Russian news site Holod urged people â€œto express their opinion about the war aloud - and also to remember that each of us has something connecting us to Ukraineâ€<9d>. It brought dozens of posts sharing memories about Ukraine and condemning the Kremlinâ€™s moves. Still, many have voiced their wholehearted support for Putinâ€™s decision. â€œIt should have been done a long time ago,â€<9d> said Irina Nareyko, a Moscow resident. â€œThese poor people who identify as Russian, who mainly identify as Orthodox, who cannot wait anymore and live expecting to be killed we should have accepted them a long time ago.â€<9d> Denis Volkov, director of the Levada Center, Russiaâ€™s top independent pollster, said that according to its poll data, more than half of Russians were ready to support Putinâ€™s moves. â€œThe situation, as it is understood by the majority, is that the west is pressuring Ukraineâ€<9d> to make a move against the rebel-held areas, â€œand Russia needs to somehow helpâ€<9d>, Volkov told the AP. The narrative of Ukraine having aggressive designs on Donbas has been actively promoted by the Russian authorities - along with accusations that the west is pumping Ukraine full of weapons and warmongering. The official rhetoric heated up last week, when Putin charged that â€œwhat is now happening in Donbas is genocideâ€<9d>. Popular newscasts and political talk shows on state TV channels started widely using the term. Prominent news anchor Dmitry Kiselev likened what was happening in Donbas to second world war atrocities committed by Nazi Germany. â€œIt is, simply, solidarity with the genocide of today,â€<9d> he charged on Russia 1s flagship news show. Russia has begun evacuating its embassy in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. According to the state news agency Tass, Russia cleared everyone from its diplomatic posts in Ukraine following the announcement of a plan to evacuate. As of Wednesday afternoon the Russian flag is no longer flying over the Kyiv embassy. Police surround the building. According to AP, after weeks of trying to project calm, Ukrainian authorities signalled increasing concern. The foreign ministry has recommended all Ukrainians living in Russia return, saying Moscowâ€™s â€œaggressionâ€<9d> could lead to a significant reduction in consular services. Ukraineâ€™s national security and defence council chief, Oleksiy Danilov, called for a national state of emergency, subject to parliamentary approval. He said it will be up to regional authorities to determine which measures to apply, but they could include additional security at public facilities, traffic restrictions and additional transport and document checks. A wave of denial-of-service attacks temporarily knocked out websites for the Ukrainian parliament, cabinet and foreign ministry, and caused delays to the defence and interior ministry websites. Many of the same sites were knocked offline last week too, in attacks that the US and UK quickly blamed on the GRU, Russian military intelligence. The Brandenburg Gate, the landmark in the German capital Berlin, has been lit up blue and yellow in a show of solidarity with Ukraine. In Paris, City Hall was similarly illuminated in the countryâ€™s national colours. â€œWe are showing our solidarity with the people of Ukraine, the many Berliners with Ukrainian roots but also with the many Russians who want peace in Russia and Ukraine,â€<9d> said the mayor of Berlin, Franziska Giffey. The EU is ready to launch a second set of sanctions against Russia if its troops move beyond Ukraine separatist regions, said Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commissionâ€™s executive vice-president. â€œIf there is further Russian aggression and further incursion into Ukraine territory we are willing to step up our response also in terms of sanctions,â€<9d> Dombrovskis told Reuters. Dombrovskis sad sanctions would include export controls, for example. â€œComing with strong sanctions against Russia is going to have some impact on the EU economy and we need to be ready for this,â€<9d> he said. â€œBut here we have the security and territorial integrity of Ukraine at stake, and we have the broader security architecture at sake, so we need to be able to react and also take some economic cost, if it is necessary.â€<9d> More from the Guardianâ€™s Julian Borger about reports of an imminent attack on Ukraine: The Guardian can confirm that the warning of an imminent attack has gone out to Ukraine and allies and that the UK shared the US assessment. Diplomats I have been talking to are aware the west has cried wolf once before, on 16 February, so there are caveats. There was also a scare last night, when some intelligence suggested an all-out attack was about to happen but it turned out to be a false alarm. The bottom line is there are large Russian formations on the move, so the assessment is that an onslaught could be unleashed at any time. More on previous reporting about US intelligence warning Ukraine of an imminent attack: A senior US defence official has said that Russia has moved nearly 100% of its troops into position needed for an invasion. The official was not able to confirm if additional troops had moved into the Donbas area. â€œThey are literally ready to go now if they get the order to go,â€<9d> said the senior official regarding the 150,000 Russian troops that are at Ukraineâ€™s borders. The senior official added that the US will do â€œas much as we can as long as we canâ€<9d> to monitor Russian troop activity from air space, reported Reuters. Two separate convoys of military equipment that did not have visible insignia were seen moving towards the city of Donetsk located in eastern Ukraine, reported Reuters. One convoy included nine tanks as well as an infantry fighting vehicle. The other convoy included trucks and fuel tanks, according to a reporter on the ground. There are reports today that US intelligence has warned Ukraine that an all-out attack is imminent. Newsweek was the first to report this story, saying that the US warned the offensive would come within 48 hours. CNNâ€™s intelligence correspondent, Katie Bo Lillis has said her reporting confirmed the Newsweek story. More from the Guardianâ€™s Julian Borger on the developing report: Katie Bo Lillis did not repeat the 48 hours timeline, just that an attack was said to be imminent, but she did say the city of Kharkiv would be particularly at risk. US intelligence has given warnings of an all-out attack before, on February 16, which came and went, though some accounts said that US assessment was that Russian commanders were told to be ready from February 16, not necessarily for an attack on that day. This story is developing - more to come. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, also spoke earlier on the Ukraine crisis, spelling out the dire consequences of Russia invading Ukraine for both countries and the global community. Thomas-Greenfield speaking on how an invasion would affect Russian civilians: Ordinary Russians should be asking how many Russian lives Putin is willing to sacrifice to feed his ambitions. If Russia continues down this path, it could ... create a new refugee crisis with as many as 5 million more people displaced. Thomas-Greenfield also added that a Russian invasion was something that no UN member state could look away from: History tells us that looking the other way is ultimately the more costly path. Urging cooperation between UN member states to counter Russiaâ€™s aggression, Thomas-Greenfield said: Now is the time to get off the sidelines. Let us together show Russia that it is isolated and alone in its aggressive actions. The Russian representative to the UN also spoke earlier during the meeting, accusing Ukraine of being anti-Russian and seemingly unhappy about UN involvement in the Ukraine crisis. During his remarks, Vasily Nebenzya accused Ukraine of genocide and human rights violations against those living in Donbas, a claim that several sources have flagged as false. Nebenzya also questioned the title of the UN assembly meeting, arguing that the title should reflect Ukraine losing territory due to its treatment of its own citizens. Nebenzya, as he wrapped up his speech, said: We urge you today to focus efforts on reigning in Kyiv and deterring it from conducting a new military adventure that might cost the whole of Ukraine very dearly. Thank you. Full quote from the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, warning the world about the global consequences of the Ukraine crisis: I warn every nation in this distinguished chamber, no one will be able to sit out this crisis if President Putin decides that he can move forward with his aggression against Ukraine. Your governments and people will face painful consequences. The United Nations general assembly meeting is happening now with delegates discussing the Ukraine crisis and Russiaâ€™s ongoing aggression. The UN chief, AntÃ³nio Guterres, said: â€œIf the conflict in Ukraine expands, the world could see a scale and severity of need unseen for many years.â€<9d> Ukraineâ€™s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, also spoke this morning to the general assembly about Russiaâ€™s aggression, urging other delegates that the crisis affects everyone. â€œWhat is happening right now in eastern Ukraine ... must be a concern for everyone. For all of you,â€<9d> said Kuleba. â€œNo one will be able to sit out this crisis.â€<9d> Spainâ€™s foreign minister, JosÃ© Manuel Albares, recommended today that Spaniards left Ukraine temporarily as soon as possible, reported Reuters. â€œWe recommend to temporarily leave the country as soon as possible and advise against travelling to Ukraine under any circumstances,â€<9d> said Albares to a parliamentary committee. Albares confirmed that about 334 Spaniards remained in Ukraine. The EU has now adopted its first sanctions package in response to â€œthe decision by the Russian Federation to proceed with the recognition of the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine as independent entities, and the subsequent decision to send Russian troops into these areas.â€<9d> Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said: Such decisions are illegal and unacceptable. They violate international law, Ukraineâ€™s territorial integrity and sovereignty, Russiaâ€™s own international commitments and further escalate the crisis. A quote from the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, at the allianceâ€™s Stronger Together conference happening today: There is much at stake in todayâ€™s crisis; the risk of conflict is real. Russia is using force and ultimatums not only to redraw borders in Europe, but to try to rewrite the entire global security architecture. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, is currently speaking at a conference with the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, highlighting some developments in the Russia-Ukraine situation. You can also watch the conference here. Ukraineâ€™s minister of digital transformation confirmed that Ukrainian banks were hit by a DDOS attack on Wednesday, following a series of cyber-attacks last week, reported Reuters. Many Ukrainian state websites, such as the government and foreign ministry home page, were not accessible today. Ukrainian authorities also confirmed that they had seen online warnings this week about hackers planning major attacks on government agencies, banks, and other sectors. This story is developing â€“ stay tuned. In his letter of invitation to tomorrowâ€™s summit of EU heads of state and government, the European Council president, Charles Michel writes: â€œThe use of force and coercion to change borders has no place in the 21st century. â€œI would like to thank you for the unity shown over the last days notably through the swift adoption today of the sanctions package by council. â€œThe aggressive actions by the Russian Federation violate international law and the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. They also undermine the European security order. â€œIt is important that we continue to be united and determined and jointly define our collective approach and actions. Therefore, I would like to invite you for a special European Council on Thursday 24 February, which will take place in person in Brussels and start at 20.00. â€œI would like us to discuss: the latest developments; how we protect the rules-based international order; how we deal with Russia, notably holding Russia accountable for its actions; how we will further support Ukraine and its people. â€œI look forward to seeing you tomorrow evening.â€<9d> Reuters, citing Interfax, is reporting that another DDOS cyber-attack has started in Ukraine. The Guardian understands that the attack has hit the websites of the parliament, cabinet ministers, the ministry of foreign affairs and the security service. It follows earlier cyber-attacks. EU leaders are to meet for an emergency summit on Thursday evening, diplomatic sources in Brussels have said. The 27 heads of state and government will debate how to further respond to Russian aggression. Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, tweeted: The use of force and coercion to change borders has no place in the 21st century. I am calling a special European Council tomorrow in Brussels to discuss the latest developments related to Ukraine and Russia. The issue of when to impose a second major tranche of sanctions is a sensitive one in Brussels. The impact of punishing Russia through sanctions on the energy sector or by cutting Russia out of the Swift financial system - which moves money from bank to bank around the world - would not be evenly felt among the 27 member states. Russia has started evacuating diplomatic staff from all of its missions in Ukraine, TASS news agency reported on Wednesday, citing a representative of the Russian Embassy in Kyiv. The embassy and the consulate general in Odessa were seen on Wednesday with Russian flags taken down. â€œSeveral cars left the territory of the consulate in the morning,â€<9d> a member of the Ukrainian National Guard who was on duty near the Russian consulate in Odessa told Reuters. Russiaâ€™s foreign ministry announced an evacuation of diplomatic staff from Ukraine for what it called safety reasons on Tuesday, a day after President Vladimir Putin recognised independence of two breakaway regions in Ukraineâ€™s east and ordered Russian troops â€œto keep peaceâ€<9d> there, while massing military along Ukrainian borders. (Via Reuters) Ukraineâ€™s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has demanded â€œimmediateâ€<9d> security guarantees from the west and Moscow to avert a feared Russian invasion. Zelenskiy made his comments as Russia began to evacuate diplomats from its Kyiv embassy after Moscow formally approved the use of military force abroad. During a joint media appearance with the visiting leaders of Poland and Lithuania on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said: Ukraine needs security guarantees. Clear, specific, and immediate. I believe that Russia must be among those countries giving clear security guarantees. Zelenskiy said that he made repeated offers to meet President Putin in an effort to head off the threat of an all-out conflict breaking out in eastern Europe. Many times now, I have offered the Russian president a chance to sit down at the negotiating table and talk. This is a question of dialogue. He also thanked Poland and Lithuania, two close Ukrainian allies, for keeping their embassies in Kyiv open despite the rising fears of a Russian attack. It is an â€œobscene perversionâ€<9d> for Putin to speak of Russian soldiers acting as peacekeepers in Ukraine, Australiaâ€™s foreign minister, Marise Payne, has said. Speaking during a visit to Prague, Payne said: Any suggestions that there is a legitimate basis for Russiaâ€™s actions are pure propaganda and disinformation. The assertion by President Putin of Russian soldiers acting as peacekeepers is indeed an obscene perversion of the noble and vital role that generations of peacekeepers have played across the world. (Via Reuters) In recent weeks, the crisis in Ukraine has been compared to discussions over the future of the democratically-run island of Taiwan. On Wednesday, Taiwanâ€™s president, Tsai Ing-wen, called on her government to be â€œvigilantâ€<9d>. Denouncing Russiaâ€™s actions, Tsai said: We should continue to strengthen the combat readiness of our forces in the Taiwan Strait to ensure our safety. [In] the face of external forces attempting to manipulate the situation in Ukraine and affect the morale in Taiwanâ€™s society, all government units must be more vigilant against cognitive warfare. Sheâ€™s not the only one who has talked about Taiwan in relation to Ukraine. At last weekâ€™s Munich Security Conference, Boris Johnson said in his warning to the international community: â€œIf Ukraine is endangered, the shock will echo around the world. And those echoes will be heard in east Asia â€” will be heard in Taiwan.â€<9d> But the latest warning from Taipei â€“ whose administration is currently run by the Democratic Progress party â€“ adds to an existing chorus of concern for the island as Beijing refrains from condemning Moscow directly. Of course, there are differences between Ukraine and Taiwan. For starters, as Chatham Houseâ€™s senior China fellow, Dr Yu Jie, pointed out yesterday: â€œUkraine is a full member of the UN, whereas Taiwan does not enjoy such status.â€<9d> Beijing is keen to dismiss such a comparison. â€œTaiwan is not Ukraine,â€<9d> Chinaâ€™s foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, said on Wednesday. â€œTaiwan has always been an inalienable part of China. This is an indisputable legal and historical fact.â€<9d> Beijing has long regarded Taiwan as its breakaway province. Huaâ€™s line echoes the views from Chinese government analysts. â€œThis association is extremely wrong. The Taiwan issue is fundamentally different from the Ukraine issue,â€<9d> said Cui Hongjian, who leads the Department for European Studies at the influential government thinktank China Institute of International Studies. Cui admitted that itâ€™s not only those from outside China who are linking Ukraine to Taiwan. Some of the comparisons, in fact, come from within China. â€œ[They] view Russiaâ€™s approach to the issue of Ukraine as a sort of â€˜modelâ€™ for the future resolution of the Taiwan question, and they advocate for closer imitation of Russia.â€<9d> Cuiâ€™s observation is very telling. He points at the rising nationalism inside China, and in particular in Chinaâ€™s cyberspace. The question is: would it sway Beijingâ€™s view of the situation? Turkeyâ€™s president, Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan, has told Putin that Ankara does not recognise steps against Ukraineâ€™s territorial integrity following Russiaâ€™s recognition of the two separatist republics in east Ukraine. Turkey, a Nato member that borders Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, has good ties with both countries and opposes sanctions on principle. It has offered to mediate the crisis and warned against military conflict. In a phone call, ErdoÄŸan told Putin military conflict in the region would not benefit anyone and repeated his offer to help achieve a solution, his office said. ErdoÄŸan also said he valued Putinâ€™s close cooperation on regional issues and wanted to continue this. President ErdoÄŸan, who renewed his call for the matter to be resolved through dialogue, stated that it was important to bring diplomacy to the forefront, and that [Turkey] continued its constructive stance in Nato as well. Earlier, ErdoÄŸan was cited by media as saying Turkey could not abandon ties with Ukraine or Russia. (Via Reuters) This from PA - see Chris Bryantâ€™s comments here: Boris Johnson has issued a correction after he wrongly claimed that Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich was the subject of targeted sanctions by the UK government. The prime minister tabled a written ministerial statement in the House of Commons to clarify such measures had not been imposed on the Russian-Israeli billionaire businessman. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson told MPs that Abramovich was â€œalready facing sanctionsâ€<9d> - a claim disputed by Labour MP Chris Bryant, among others. In his new statement, the prime minister reiterated the UK governmentâ€™s first wave of sanctions following Russiaâ€™s actions against Ukraine had seen â€œoligarchs at the heart of Putinâ€™s inner circle and banks which have bankrolled the Russian occupation of Crimeaâ€<9d> among those targeted. He added on Wednesday: Roman Abramovich has not been the subject of targeted measures. More generally anyone who comes to this country on an Israeli passport is a non-visa national. Israelis are required to obtain a visa if they want to live, work or study in the UK. Abramovich had issues around his entrepreneurial visa in 2018. In October 2021, the businessmanâ€™s spokesperson confirmed he travelled to London as an Israeli citizen - therefore entering the United Kingdom without the need for a visa. Channel 4â€™s international editor, Lindsey Hilsum, is one of quite a few journalists who point out that UK action against RT could have consequences for the BBC in Russia ... Angus Roxburgh, a former BBC Moscow correspondent and consultant to the Kremlin, thinks the UK needs to rethink how it pursues sanctions. Going after Russian oligarchs, he writes for the Guardian, has little effect on Russian policy: The idea that they [the oligarchs] influence his policies is pure fantasy. The proof of that is that sanctions regularly meted out on oligarchs since 2014 have made not one jot of difference to Putinâ€™s policies. The west imposed sanctions over Crimea, the downing of a Malaysian passenger jet over Ukraine and the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. None of them elicited so much as an expression of regret, far less a change of course. What they did do, of course, was deepen Putinâ€™s already simmering hatred of the west.â€<9d> Better, Roxburgh writes, to target the political class, â€œthe members of the Duma, the Senate, the presidential council, the top echelons of the security and defence services, top state television employeesâ€<9d>. He adds: These men (and some women) draft, rubber-stamp, promote and carry out Putinâ€™s decisions. Some of them also â€“ unlike the oligarchs â€“ actually advise him â€¦ These are the people to target â€“ because when several thousand of the people Putin actually depends on begin to feel the consequences of his policies in their personal lives, there will be a groundswell of discontent.â€<9d> You can read the whole article here: Continuing the sanctions theme, the deputy US Treasury secretary, Wally Adeyemo, has told CNBC that the US is prepared to withhold technology and resources from Russia if Vladimir Putin takes further action against Ukraine. Adeyemo said: President Putin clearly has the ability to do much more than he has done so far. The key thing that President Putin needs to consider is whether he wants to ensure that Russiaâ€™s economy is able to grow, that he has the resources he needs to be able to project power in the future. If he chooses to invade, what weâ€™re telling him very directly, is that weâ€™re going to cut that off. Weâ€™re going to cut him off from western technology thatâ€™s critical to advancing his military, cut him off from western financial resources that will be critical for feeding his economy and also to enriching himself.â€<9d> Reuters reports that people familiar with the matter have told the news agency that the Biden administration could deprive Russia of a vast swath of low and high-tech US and foreign-made goods, from commercial electronics and computers to semiconductors and aircraft parts. Ukraine deserves European Union candidate status, and Poland and Lithuania will support it in this goal, the presidents of the two countries said in a joint declaration with the Ukrainian president on Wednesday. Reuters carries the declaration, signed in Kyiv by Ukraineâ€™s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, and the Lithuanian president, Gitanas NausÄ—da: We emphasise that, given the significant progress in the implementation of the Association Agreement and internal reforms, as well as the current security challenges, Ukraine deserves EU candidate status and Lithuania and Poland will support Ukraine in achieving this goal.â€<9d> The joint declaration calls on the international community for â€œswift introductionâ€<9d> of â€œrobustâ€<9d> sanctions on Russia, including measures targeting the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between Russia and Germany. Chris Bryant, the Labour MP and member of the UKâ€™s Commons foreign affairs select committee, has been withering in his assessment of the UKâ€™s sanctions effort thus far: Bryant wrote for the Guardian on a similar subject in an opinion article published on Tuesday evening. In a briefing on Wednesday Boris Johnsonâ€™s spokesperson said the government was holding further sanctions against Russia in readiness if the situation escalated further. EU ambassadors in Brussels have agreed on the current package of sanctions against Russia. The package is expected to be adopted and implemented at 15:00 CET today. Some EU capitals had expressed an aspiration for a â€œbig bang sanctions packageâ€<9d> to come soon after, echoing the debate in the UK, diplomats said. This excellent, in-depth visual guide is well worth a look if you want to know how we got here - and what could happen next â€¦ More here on the popeâ€™s words from my colleague in Rome, Angela Giuffrida: Pope Francis warned of â€œincreasingly alarming scenariosâ€<9d> in Ukraine during his weekly audience on Wednesday, saying the threat of war caused â€œgreat pain in my heartâ€<9d> while appealing to all sides â€œto abstain from any action that could provoke more suffering to the populations, destabilising coexistence among nations and discrediting international lawâ€<9d>. The pontiff proclaimed Ash Wednesday, which falls on 2 March, a day of international prayer for peace and fasting: Jesus taught us that we should respond to the diabolic senselessness of violence with the weapons of God, with prayer and fasting. Denis Pushilin, the leader of the Russian-controlled territory in Donetsk, has said that he will not immediately order an attack on Ukrainian positions on the front line but will not rule out a â€œmilitary solutionâ€<9d> to expanding his regionâ€™s borders either. Appearing alongside the head of Russiaâ€™s ruling United Russia party, Pushilin said the Russian-backed separatists were not yet at the stage of a â€œmilitary solution to [expanding] the regionâ€™s bordersâ€<9d>. He said: Weâ€™re not at that point yet. Weâ€™re at the point where the enemyâ€™s forces are located at the front line and could go on the offensive at any moment. There are no indications that Ukraine has prepared any kind of offensive. But it could likely be a pretext for Russia to formally attack Ukrainian positions. â€œWe havenâ€™t done anything about this yet,â€<9d> said Pushilin, referring to the border issue. â€œWe havenâ€™t taken it in hand.â€<9d> Russia has denied it is planning to send a large deployment of troops and equipment into the area, although photographs from Russiaâ€™s Rostov region suggest a considerable buildup on the borders with the territories. The remarks came during a visit by a delegation of Russian lawmakers to the region. Andrey Turchak, the head of the United Russia party, said that the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, would soon hold formal meetings with diplomats from the two regions, which have only been recognised by a handful of states led by Russia. Franceâ€™s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, has said Putin no longer accepts Ukraineâ€™s independence under international law, AFP reports. â€œPresident Putin in his speech [on Monday] declared in a sense the negation of Ukraine as a sovereign country,â€<9d> Le Drian told reporters after talks with his German counterpart, Annalena Baerbock, in Berlin. Le Drian said Putinâ€™s decision to recognise two breakaway regions in Ukraine smacked of â€œrevisionismâ€<9d> and a bid to â€œreinvent historyâ€<9d>. In general, he is not keeping his promises, neither in public nor in private, whether to President Macron or to Chancellor Scholz. When or how should we believe what President Putin says? I donâ€™t know if anyone knows. When asked about the likelihood of a full Russian invasion, Le Drian said that with â€œ140,000 [Russian] troopsâ€<9d> massed on Ukraineâ€™s borders â€œanything is possible, including the worstâ€<9d>. Baerbock accused Putin of â€œlyingâ€<9d> about his intentions in Ukraine in talks with western leaders in recent days. â€œWhen you do the opposite of what you said a week ago then you didnâ€™t tell the truth or, in plain German: you lied,â€<9d> she told reporters. It is the Russian president who took the decision to completely violate international law, to trample on international law, and to contribute to the fact that we are now no longer talking about shared peace in Europe but rather how we can continue to avoid a war. Baerbock said the west was â€œprepared for all scenariosâ€<9d> including a full Russian invasion of Ukraine, adding that sanctions already agreed with European partners â€œcan be increased at any timeâ€<9d>. Russiaâ€™s defence minister, commanders-in-chief of the Russian air force and Black Sea fleet, leading state â€œpropagandistsâ€<9d> - as well as 351 Duma deputies - are expected to be targeted in EU sanctions announced later on Wednesday, with the bloc imposing asset freezes and travel bans on 23 people, three banks and a notorious internet â€œtroll factoryâ€<9d> in St Petersburg. Ukraine has advised its estimated 3 million citizens living in Russia to leave the country, in the latest signal that Kyiv believes Moscow may be planning an invasion. It is also mulling the declaration of a state of emergency. Russia has issued a defiant response to sanctions, suggesting the move would hurt global financial and energy markets as well as ordinary citizens. The UK defence secretary has accused Putin of going â€œfull tontoâ€<9d> and said the Russian president has made the mistake of having no allies in his actions. The British government has defended its sanctions plan amid criticism, insisting that a â€œvery serious packageâ€<9d> of sanctions will â€œinflict painâ€<9d> on Putin. Russiaâ€™s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, the commanders-in-chief of the Russian Air Force and Black Sea Fleet, leading state â€œpropagandistsâ€<9d> - as well as 351 Duma deputies - are expected to be targeted in EU sanctions announced later on Wednesday. The measures, which have to be signed off by EU foreign ministers, would go further than those announced by the US - and well beyond Boris Johnsonâ€™s Russia sanctions. If approved, the EU will impose asset freezes and travel bans on 23 people, three banks and a notorious internet â€˜troll factoryâ€™ in St Petersburg, in response to Russian president Vladimir Putinâ€™s decision to recognise the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states. The bloc is also expected to sanction 351 members of the Russian state Duma that voted for recognition of the two territories. The Russian government will also see further restrictions on its ability to raise money on EU financial markets. EU officials are also drawing up measures to ban trade between the two Russian-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine, mirroring earlier sanctions on Crimea in 2014. â€œEveryone seems on board for the adoption of sanctions,â€<9d> an EU diplomat said. EU capitals have a few hours to send comments, with ministers expected to approve the sanctions at 3pm CET. At the top of the sanctions list is Shoigu, because he is â€œultimately responsible for any military action against Ukraineâ€<9d>, according to the draft list seen by the Guardian. He is joined by Anton Vaino, Putinâ€™s chief of staff, who â€œplays an active role in decision makingâ€<9d>, as well as Igor Osipov, commander-in-chief of the Black Sea Fleet, and Sergei Surovikin, commander-in-chief of Russian Aerospace Forces. Other top officials include deputy prime minister and chair of state-owned VTB bank, Dmitry Grigorenko, and Igor Shuvalov, chair of Russiaâ€™s state development bank, VEB, which plays an important role in funding its defence sector. The EU is also targeting Russian â€œpropagandistsâ€<9d>, including foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, and the head of the RT channel, Margarita Simonyan, both of whom are known for their strident anti-western rhetoric. Vladimir Solovyov, the pro-Kremlin presenter of the Russia One channel, also makes the list. Other notable figures include Yevgeniy Prigozhin. Known as Putinâ€™s chef, Prigozhin finances the Internet Research Agency (IRA), which has also been added to the EU sanctions list. Based in St Petersburg, the IRA is better known as the â€œtroll factoryâ€<9d> , where bloggers work around the clock to flood the global internet with pro-Putin and anti-western views. According to US sanctions, Prigozhin is also believed to be the â€œmanager and financierâ€<9d> of the Wagner mercenary group, which is already subject to EU sanctions for its role in sending forces into conflicts in west Africa. Prigozhinâ€™s mother and wife, who own companies with links to him, are also on the draft list. The sanctioned banks are Bank Rossiya, believed by EU and western officials to be the personal bank for Putin and many of his officials, as well as Promsvyazbank and Vnesheconombank, both considered by EU officials to be instructed personally by the Russian president, with a key role in financing Russiaâ€™s defence sector. EU leaders have signalled further sanctions could follow in the coming days. â€œExpect some more discussions on the broader big bang sanctions package later this week,â€<9d> said the EU official. Ben Wallace, the former Scots Guards officer who now serves as the UK defence secretary, has accused Vladimir Putin of going â€œfull tontoâ€<9d> over Ukraine, PA reports. Wallace said the Russian president has made the mistake of having no allies in his actions, comparing him to Tsar Nicholas I during the Crimean War. Wallace said his old regiment had â€œkicked the backsideâ€<9d> of the tsar in the Crimea and â€œwe can always do it againâ€<9d>. The unguarded comments came as the cabinet minister chatted with serving military personnel at the Horse Guards building in Westminster. He said: Itâ€™s going to be a busy army. Unfortunately weâ€™ve got a busy adversary now in Putin, who has gone full tonto. Wallace said the UK had 1,000 personnel on standby to respond to the crisis, adding: The Scots Guards kicked the backside of Tsar Nicholas I in 1853 in Crimea - we can always do it again. Tsar Nicholas I made the same mistake Putin did â€¦ he had no friends, no alliances. Eight senior Russian security officials and the oil and gas sectors will be targeted in the first round of Australian sanctions, with the prime minister vowing to go after anyone â€œaiding and abettingâ€<9d> the invasion of Ukraine. Scott Morrison met with the cabinetâ€™s national security committee on Wednesday before declaring the Russian government was â€œbehaving like thugs and bulliesâ€<9d> and there â€œmust be consequences for Russiaâ€™s actionsâ€<9d>. Morrison characterised the sanctions as only the first step of Australiaâ€™s response and indicated Australian security agencies were on alert for possible counter-actions by Russia such as espionage and cyber attacks. Ukraineâ€™s National Security and Defence Council has asked parliament to impose a state of emergency throughout Ukraine, except for Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts â€“ the areas claimed by Russia â€“ where one has already been in place for many years. The council met after Russia began moving troops across the border into the separatist-held territories it recognised on Monday, and the US announced that the invasion of Ukraine it had been warning about for weeks had begun. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the council, told journalists after the meeting that the state of emergency allowed the government to bring in controls including restrictions on movement, and curfews. However curfews are not currently expected to be brought in, and would only be imposed in case of increased Russian aggression, he said. He also confirmed that the country was calling up the first 36,000 military reservists. The country has nearly half a million veterans with frontline experience in the east, so potentially still has a large pool of fighters it could call up. Danilov said each of Ukraineâ€™s regions would be able to select which particular measures to apply, â€œdepending on how necessary they might beâ€<9d>. â€œWhat could it be? This could be added enforcement of public order,â€<9d> Danilov said. â€œThis could involve limiting certain types of transport, increased vehicle checks, or asking people to show this or that document,â€<9d> he added, calling it a â€œpreventiveâ€<9d> measure. The ministry of foreign affairs also called on all Ukrainian citizens to leave Russia. China has accused the US of creating â€œfear and panicâ€<9d> over the crisis in Ukraine, and called for talks to reduce rapidly building tensions, AP reports. The foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said China was opposed to new unilateral sanctions imposed on Russia, reiterating a longstanding Chinese position. She said the US was fuelling tensions by providing defensive weapons to Ukraine, without mentioning Russiaâ€™s deployment of as many as 190,000 troops on the Ukrainian border. Hua also did not mention efforts by the US, France and others to engage Russia diplomatically. China-Russia ties have grown closer under the Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who hosted the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, at talks in Beijing earlier this month. The two sides issued a joint statement backing Moscowâ€™s opposition to a Nato expansion in former Soviet republics and buttressing Chinaâ€™s claim to the self-governing island of Taiwan. Speaking at a daily briefing on Wednesday, Hua said: On the Ukraine issue, unlike the US, which keeps sending weapons to Ukraine, creating fear and panic and even playing up the threat of war, China has been calling on all parties to respect and pay attention to each otherâ€™s legitimate security concerns, work together to solve problems through negotiations and consultations, and maintain regional peace and stability. The outcome of the Ukraine crisis is seen as having ramifications for China over its threat to invade Taiwan, a close US ally, and its border dispute with India and its claims in the South China and East China seas, where it has raised concerns over conflict with Japan, the Philippines and others. Ukraineâ€™s parliament has voted to approve in the first reading a draft law which gives permission to Ukrainians to carry firearms and act in self-defence. â€œThe adoption of this law is fully in the interests of the state and society,â€<9d> the authors of the draft law said in a note, adding that the law was needed due to â€œexisting threats and dangers for the citizens of Ukraineâ€<9d>. (Via Reuters) Germany can meet its energy needs without Russian gas, its economy minister said on Wednesday, a day after the government decided to halt the approval of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline amid rising Ukraine tensions. Asked on public radio if Europeâ€™s largest economy could do without natural gas deliveries from Russia, currently its largest supplier, Robert Habeck responded, â€œYes, it canâ€<9d>. On Tuesday, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the approval of the NordStream 2 pipeline from Russia would be suspended in response to Putinâ€™s decision to recognise two breakaway regions of Ukraine. Cutting itself off completely from Russian gas would leave a big hole in the market that in the first instance would â€œdrive prices higherâ€<9d>, said Habeck of the Green party. However Germanyâ€™s power demands could be â€œcompensatedâ€<9d> with other energy sources and suppliers, including an accelerated renewables push set out by the government, he said. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was completed but never approved by regulators, was set to increase Germanyâ€™s dependency on Russia for gas to 70% of its total deliveries. The project was consistently supported by the previous chancellor Angela Merkel, who left office at the end of last year, as well as her successor Scholz - until the current crisis. (Via AFP) Russiaâ€™s state-funded broadcaster RT is not happy with Liz Trussâ€™s suggestion that the UKâ€™s broadcast regulator, Ofcom, would be looking at RTâ€™s output, Reuters reports. RTâ€™s deputy editor in chief and head of communications, Anna Belkina, said: It is unfortunate that Minister Truss, and, recently, a select few other UK politicians, seem to be trying to directly or indirectly interfere in institutions they tout as supposedly independent and wholly free from political pressure. These comments once more undermine the independence of the UK regulator.â€<9d> Ukraineâ€™s parliament has approved imposing sanctions on 351 Russians, including lawmakers who supported the recognition of the independence of separatist-controlled territories and the use of Russian troops in eastern Ukraine. The sanctions restrict almost all possible types of activities, in particular a ban on entry into Ukraine, prohibit access to assets, capital, property, licenses for business. The security council was due to impose the sanctions after the vote. (Via Reuters) Ukraineâ€™s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, wants the west to ratchet up its sanctions on Russia: â€œHit more. Hit hard. Hit now.â€<9d> The country is also advising its citizens to leave Russia, with the foreign ministry recommending â€œthat citizens of Ukraine refrain from any trips to the Russian Federation, and those who are in this country to leave its territory immediatelyâ€<9d>. There are estimated to be 3 million Ukrainians living in Russia. Pope Francis has called on political leaders to look to their consciences, Reuters reports. On Wednesday the pope said the threat of war in Ukraine had caused â€œgreat pain in my heartâ€<9d>, and urged politicians to make a serious examination of conscience before God about their actions. Speaking in a sombre tone at the end of his weekly general audience, Francis urged leaders to abstain from any moves that would cause further suffering for people and proclaimed Ash Wednesday - 2 March - an international day of fasting and prayer for peace. Japan will impose sanctions on Russia and individuals linked to Ukrainian regions controlled by pro-Kremlin separatists. Wednesdayâ€™s announcement follows similar measures by the US, the UK and the EU. Japan strongly condemns Russiaâ€™s actions â€œthat infringe on Ukraineâ€™s sovereignty and territorial integrity, violating international lawâ€<9d>, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters. â€œFrom the viewpoint of responding to the issue in cooperation with the international community, Japan decided to impose sanctions.â€<9d> The Japanese sanctions include a ban on issuing visas to individuals linked to the â€œso-called two republicsâ€<9d> as well as freezing their assets and barring trade with the regions. There will also be a ban on the issuing and trade of Russian government bonds in Japan. Kishida said further sanctions were possible if the situation worsened. (Via AFP) And more on the sanctions row - this time from a prominent Conservative figure. The former UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt says the British government needs to take action that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is â€œnot expectingâ€<9d>. Speaking to BBC Radio 4â€™s Today programme, Hunt said: We do need to go further, and I suspect the government wanted to. Theyâ€™ve been pretty robust in what theyâ€™ve said but itâ€™s very important to go in lockstep with our allies in a situation like this. But what we have to remember is that Putin has both predicted these sanctions and indeed further sanctions - and discounted them. If we are going to avoid being two steps behind in the diplomatic chess game, we have to do some things that heâ€™s not expecting. The most important is to do sanctions - economic and financial sanctions - that are tough enough and last long enough to reduce the ability of the Russian state to finance the Russian military. And that means we have got to be prepared to dig in for the long term and not do what Iâ€™m afraid has happened all too often, which is that you get a future government that decides they want to reset relations with Moscow, as, for example, President Obama did when he became president, and they cancel previous sanctions or penalties and Russia can feel that itâ€™s got away with what itâ€™s done. (Via PA) The row over the UK governmentâ€™s sanctions package is still going strong today. This from the i newspaperâ€™s Paul Waugh and the Labour MP Chris Bryant, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Russia â€¦ Liz Truss says she believes Putin is â€œhell-bentâ€<9d> on invading Ukraine. Challenged on whether the current UK sanctions are tough enough to stop the Russian state financing the military, she told BBC Radio 4â€™s Today programme: One of the banks that weâ€™ve sanctioned is the bank that finances the Russian military, so we are absolutely taking that step. I believe that Putin is hell-bent on invading Ukraine. This is about inflicting pain on Putin and degrading the Russian economic system over time, targeting people that are close to Putin. But if youâ€™re asking me is he paying attention, my view is that he wants to invade, this is a long-standing plan. And what we have to do is make it as painful as possible, both by supplying support to the Ukrainian government in terms of defensive weapons, in terms of economic support, and by imposing economic costs. (Via PA) From the Guardianâ€™s Brussels correspondent ... Truss has also used the BBC Breakfast interview to defend the government against accusations that its sanctions are nowhere near stringent enough. She said: These are the toughest sanctions weâ€™ve ever put on Russia. Theyâ€™re targeting people who are very close to the Kremlin - absolutely key oligarchs. Theyâ€™re targeting banks that fund the Russian military and key banks that keep the Russian regime going. Weâ€™re also making sure that Russia wonâ€™t be able to raise sovereign debt on international markets. Weâ€™re making sure that the territorial sanctions will be in place in those regions as well. Weâ€™re targeting politicians in the Russian parliament who voted for that recognition [of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk] to take place. The EU is going through its formal procedures for imposing its first tranche of sanctions on Russia following political agreement on Tuesday and scrutiny of legal text last night. An agenda item has been added to this morningâ€™s meeting of EU ambassadors with regard to approval of the legal texts. The 27 EU member states can provide â€œminimalâ€<9d> input to the presidency of the EU, which is currently held by France. The ambassadors will approve the text and launch a so-called â€œwritten procedureâ€<9d>, which gives foreign ministers up until 3pm today to give their formal approval remotely without the need for a further meeting. A diplomatic source said: â€œExpect some more discussions on the broader big bang sanctions package later this week.â€<9d> Russian forces massing near Ukraineâ€™s borders can only remain in position for a few days before they have to be sent back to nearby bases or risk their capability being significantly degraded, western officials and experts believe. That means that President Vladimir Putin will come under increasing pressure to use them in a full invasion of Ukraine â€“ or send them back to staging areas, still in Russiaâ€™s south or west, but tens or even hundreds of kilometres back. Such advance positions, often with poor protection from the cold, can be held only for a short period â€“ and there is some evidence on social media of the poor conditions endured by soldiers near the border. This is Sam Jones, taking on the blog for the next few hours. Australiaâ€™s prime minister, Scott Morrison, says the country will target Russia with a round of sanctions and will â€œratchet upâ€<9d> the response should military action in Ukraine continue. Heâ€™s also accused Russia of behaving â€œlike thugs and bulliesâ€<9d>. Sanctions and travel bans will target eight members of the Russian Federationâ€™s security council, while existing sanctions in place over past aggression will be expanded. Russian banks have also been targeted. Morrison said he expected further tranches of sanctions against more individuals but remained tight-lipped about who would be targeted. He told reporters in Sydney: We will take this step by step and I can assure you those steps will get stronger and stronger. Meanwhile, Russiaâ€™s ambassador to Australia, Alexey Pavlovsky, met with the secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday afternoon, following the announcement of the sanctions. Morrison, who convened cabinetâ€™s national security committee on Wednesday, said Russia needed to understand the worldâ€™s condemnation of its decision. He said: The invasion of Ukraine has effectively already begun. Theyâ€™re acting like thugs and bullies. Australians always stand up to bullies and we will be standing up to Russia. (Via Australian Associated Press) Thanks for joining me, Samantha Lock, for all the latest developments surrounding the Ukraine crisis. Iâ€™ll now be handing over to my colleague Sam Jones who will continue to bring you all the latest updates. As many westerns nations rush to impose sanctions on Russia, Chinaâ€™s foreign ministry has said it opposes the measures and does not believe sanctions are the best way to solve problems, Reuters is reporting. China hopes relevant parties can try to resolve their issues through dialogue and remain calm and exercise restraint, ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told reporters in Beijing. Some photos from last nightâ€™s pro-Ukraine rally in the city of Mariupol in south eastern Ukraine have emerged. Freelance photojournalist, Olga Tokariuk, who is based in Kyiv shared some snaps taken by her colleague Andriy Tsapliyenko. â€œPeople here wonâ€™t be welcoming Russian soldiers,â€<9d> she said. In the latest slew of sanctions to hit Moscow, Britain will stop Russia selling sovereign debt in London after Putin deployed military forces into two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine, UK foreign secretary Liz Truss said on Wednesday. Truss said that if Putin went further and ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine then sanctions would be escalated, PA Media reports. Russiaâ€™s ambassador to the United States has hit back at the imposition of sanctions imposed by US president Joe Biden, suggesting the move would hurt global financial and energy markets as well as ordinary citizens. According to a recent post on the Russian embassy Facebook page early Wednesday, ambassador Anatoly Antonov said: Sanctions will not solve anything regarding Russia. Itâ€™s hard to imagine that anyone in Washington is counting on Russia to review its foreign policy course under threat of restrictions. I donâ€™t remember a single day when our country lived without any restrictions from the Western world. We learned how to work in such conditions. And not only survive, but also develop our state. There is no doubt that the sanctions imposed against us will hurt the global financial and energy markets. The United States will not be left out, where ordinary citizens will feel the full consequences of rising prices.â€<9d> South Korea is considering the possibility of joining sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine crisis after speaking with the United States. However, the east Asian nation is not considering military assistance, the Yonhap news agency said on Wednesday, citing the presidential Blue House. The Ukrainian military has said another soldier was killed and six wounded in shelling by pro-Russian separatists in east Ukraine in the past 24 hours. The military said it had recorded 96 incidents of shelling by separatists over the past 24 hours, 81 of which were with the use of heavy weapons, compared with 84 a day earlier, according to Ukraineâ€™s joint forces operation situation recently published report. It said separatist forces used heavy artillery, mortars and Grad rocket systems. Russian President Vladimir Putin says Moscow is ready to look for â€œdiplomatic solutionsâ€<9d> over Ukraine but stressed that the countryâ€™s interests were non-negotiable. In a video address on Wednesday morning to mark the Defender of the Fatherland Day, a public holiday in Russia, Agence France-Press cites Putin as saying: Our country is always open for direct and honest dialogue, for the search for diplomatic solutions to the most complex problems. The interests of Russia, the security of our citizens, are non-negotiable for us.â€<9d> In the video address, Putin congratulated the countryâ€™s men, praised the battle-readiness of the Russian army and said he was certain of the â€œprofessionalismâ€<9d> of the military and that they will stand up for the countryâ€™s national interests. His speech follows Russiaâ€™s unanimous approval to deploy â€œpeacekeepersâ€<9d> to two self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk now recognised by Moscow as independent. Putin said Russia would continue to develop state-of-the-art weapons. We will continue to develop advanced weapon systems, including hypersonic and those based on new physical principles, and expand the use of advanced digital technologies and elements of artificial intelligence. Such complexes are truly the weapons of the future, which significantly increase the combat potential of our armed forces.â€<9d> We earlier reported a cache of satellite images showing a new deployment of more than 100 military vehicles and dozens of troop tents in southern Belarus near the Ukraine border. The images - published by private US company on Tuesday - reportedly show a new field hospital has been added to a military garrison in western Russia close to the border with Ukraine, according to a statement from Maxar Technologies, which has been tracking the buildup of Russian forces for weeks. The images could not be independently verified by Reuters however they have been widely shared by correspondents reporting from Ukraine. British prime minister Boris Johnson has been urged to impose tougher sanctions on Russia after announcing on Tuesday that three billionaire allies of the Russian President and five Russian banks would face punitive measures. The prime minister is likely to come under fire in the Commons today and will criticism from all sides for not going far enough, PA Media reports. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said â€œwe must be prepared to go furtherâ€<9d>, while the sanctions were branded as â€œgruelâ€<9d> by the Liberal Democratsâ€™ Layla Moran. Former Tory foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that â€œPutin will have predicted and discounted western sanctions long ago, so does he (Johnson) agree that if we are not to be behind in the diplomatic chess game, we need to do some things that he is not expecting?â€<9d>. Tobias Ellwood, Conservative chairman of the defence committee, said: â€œSanctions alone will not be enough, indeed untargeted sanctions may play into Putinâ€™s plan to pivot Russia ever closer to China.â€<9d> Former Tory minister Mark Harper asked for assurances that Boris Johnson will implement â€œfurther and stronger measures even if President Putin does no moreâ€<9d>. Johnson and Downing Street insisted this was only the â€œfirst barrageâ€<9d> of measures, where â€œvery high net wealth individualsâ€<9d> Gennady Timchenko, Boris Rotenberg and Igor Rotenberg - who he described as â€œcroniesâ€<9d> of the Russian president - were targeted. The sanctions, which include UK asset freezes, a travel ban and prohibition on British individuals and businesses dealing with them, were also tabled against Russian banks Rossiya, IS Bank, General Bank, Promsvyazbank and the Black Sea Bank. Russiaâ€™s ministry of defence has just issued a bizarre call out, urging Russians to celebrate their â€œfatherlandâ€<9d> by installing photos of military might on their desktops. US secretary of state Antony Blinken earlier said an invasion of Ukraine had been Russian president Vladimir Putinâ€™s â€œplan all alongâ€<9d>, calling the situation a â€œmanufactured crisisâ€<9d>. In a joint press conference with Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba in Washington held on Tuesday evening local time, Blinken said: His plan all along has been to invade Ukraine; to control Ukraine and its people; to destroy Ukraineâ€™s democracy, which offers a stark contrast to the autocracy that he leads; to reclaim Ukraine as a part of Russia. Thatâ€™s why this is the greatest threat to security in Europe since world war twoâ€<9d>. During the press conference, Blinken also added that he will no longer be meeting with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in Paris on Friday as planned : â€œNow that we see the invasion is beginning and Russia has made clear its wholesale rejection of diplomacy it does not make sense to go forward that meeting at this time.â€<9d> The meeting followed Joe Bidenâ€™s announcement on Tuesday about the first round of sanctions against Russian banks, oligarchs and others, with plans to escalate sanctions if Russia advances its invasion. Video of the press conference is also available here. The UKâ€™s foreign secretary Liz Truss has revealed potential further UK sanctions on Russia, warning those close to Putin will see his incursion into Ukraine as a â€œself-inflicted woundâ€<9d> and adding â€œnothing is off the tableâ€<9d>. British prime minister Boris Johnson announced on Tuesday that three billionaire allies of the Russian president and five Russian banks would face punitive measures in response to their countryâ€™s aggression. Truss said the UK was also considering sanctions for members of the Russian Duma and Federation Council, and extending Crimeaâ€™s territorial sanctions to the separatist controlled territories in the Donbas. Writing in The Times, she said: Putin is ... undermining Europeâ€™s security and stability. We will use every lever at our disposal to stop him in his tracks. We have put in place our toughest sanctions regime against Russia. Nothing is off the table. This first wave will target the individuals and companies closest to the Kremlin. Truss added that â€œno UK individual or business will be able to deal with these territories until they are returned to Ukraine.â€<9d> Truss also said the UK has a â€œlong listâ€<9d> of people who have been complicit in the actions of the Russian leadership, who the government is willing to â€œ(turn) up the heatâ€<9d> on unless Russia pulls back its forces. Beyond financial sanctions, Truss added the UK was willing to introduce â€œmeasures to limit Russiaâ€™s ability to trade and prohibit a range of high-tech exports, degrading the development of its military industrial base for yearsâ€<9d>. â€œIn time, even those close to President Putin will come to see his decisions this week as a self-inflicted wound.â€<9d> Welcome to our live blog on the Ukraine crisis. Iâ€™m Samantha Lock. There have been a number of important developments over the last few hours so if youâ€™re just joining us or need a quick recap, here are some of the main points: US secretary of state Antony Blinken said an invasion of Ukraine had been Vladimir Putinâ€™s â€œplan all alongâ€<9d>, calling the situation a â€œmanufactured crisisâ€<9d>. He also cancelled a meeting planned for Friday with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. US president Joe Biden announced sanctions against Russia and the Russian presidentâ€™s decision to send troops into eastern Ukraine was the â€œbeginning of the invasion of Ukraineâ€<9d>. The sanctions will target Russian banks and sovereign debt, as well as prominent members of what Biden called the Russian â€œeliteâ€<9d>. Ukraineâ€™s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the sanctions but said they werenâ€™t enough to discourage Putin. Speaking in Washington with Blinken, he said the US must help his country because the future of the world order â€œis being decided right now in Ukraineâ€<9d>. Russiaâ€™s ambassador to the US hit back at the sanctions, suggesting the move would hurt global financial and energy markets as well as ordinary citizens. The UK and European Union also announced similar sanctions to the US but were criticised as not being strong enough, and could also come at a cost for the west. Australia and Japan followed suit. Ukraineâ€™s president has called up the countryâ€™s reservists and warned that Ukraine could face a battle for its very existence. Satellite images show a new deployment of more than 100 military vehicles and dozens of troop tents in southern Belarus and in Russia near the Ukraine border, a private US company said. Canada delivered a second aircraft to Ukraine filled with â€œlethal military aidâ€<9d>, calling Russiaâ€™s invasion of a sovereign state â€œabsolutely unacceptableâ€<9d>. Oil prices only rose slightly on Wednesdayâ€™s as the market judged that sanctions against Russia will not disrupt supplies from the worldâ€™s third largest producer.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Arthur do Val, a SÃ£o Paulo congressman and former supporter of Brazilâ€™s rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro, made a three-day trip to the region last week, supposedly to raise awareness of the human cost of Vladimir Putinâ€™s attack. On Thursday Do Val, 35, tweeted a photograph of himself surrounded by crates of motolov cocktails in the border city of Uzhhorod. His traveling partner, the rightwing activist Renan Santos, said they had donated thousands of dollars, helped refugees cross the border and â€œfilmed the reality of a country at warâ€<9d>. Do Valâ€™s trip had the blessing of Sergio Moro, the conservative ex-judge and minister who hopes to challenge Bolsonaro and his leftwing rival Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva in Octoberâ€™s presidential election. â€œItâ€™s always commendable when we put our words into practice,â€<9d> Moro tweeted. Such ostensibly noble objectives were shattered on Friday, however, when the Brazilian media published audio messages in which Do Val spoke in highly offensive terms about Ukrainian refugees â€“ more than 1.3 million of whom have fled overseas since Vladimir Putinâ€™s 24 February invasion. In one recording, the politician says: â€œIâ€™ve just crossed the border on foot between Ukraine and Slovakia. Bro, I swear to you â€¦ Iâ€™ve never seen anything like it in terms of beautiful girls. The refugee queue â€¦ itâ€™s like 200metres-long or more of just total goddesses â€¦ itâ€™s some incredible shit â€¦ the queue outside Brazilâ€™s best nightclub â€¦ doesnâ€™t come close to the refugee queue here.â€<9d> In a second excerpt, Do Val says: â€œLet me tell you, theyâ€™re easy because theyâ€™re poor.â€<9d> In a third he makes obscene remarks about female security officials at the Ukraine/Slovakia border, before adding: â€œJust unbelievable, dude. As soon as this warâ€™s over, Iâ€™m coming back.â€<9d> The comments sparked revulsion, with more than 40,000 people signing an online petition demanding Do Valâ€™s expulsion from SÃ£o Pauloâ€™s 94-seat parliament. Fabiana Tronenko, the wife of Ukraineâ€™s former ambassador to Brazil, published a tearful Twitter video in which she called the politician a shameless cretin. â€œShow some respect, you punk â€¦ youâ€™ve no idea what the Ukrainian people are going through.â€<9d> Ukraineâ€™s chargÃ© dâ€™affaires in Brazil, Anatoliy Tkach, called the remarks unacceptable. Do Val, who returned to Brazil on Saturday to discover he had lost key allies and his girlfriend, apologised and sought to justify his words. After three days â€œwithout drinking water or having a showerâ€<9d> he claimed he had become â€œover-excitedâ€<9d>. â€œMy mind was racing. I talked nonsense,â€<9d> he said, abandoning plans to run for SÃ£o Pauloâ€™s governorship. Critics were unimpressed, calling his behaviour typical of Brazilâ€™s chauvinist and testosterone-charged hard-right. â€œHow nauseating,â€<9d> tweeted Gleisi Hoffmann, the president of Brazilâ€™s Workersâ€™ party. â€œThis is the kind of person who elected Bolsonaro! He must be stripped of power.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

After early morning missile attacks, Russian forces advanced to the cityâ€™s outskirts from three sides on Friday as Ukrainian soldiers set up defensive positions at key bridges and patrolled in armoured vehicles watched by anxious residents. A day after Russia launched a massive invasion of its south-western neighbour, the defence ministry in Moscow claimed it had cut Kyiv off from the west and seized a strategic airport at Hostomel, on the outskirts, allowing it to airlift troops to the front. In an extraordinary message addressed to Ukrainian troops, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, called on them to overthrow the government, whose leaders he described as â€œterroristsâ€<9d> and â€œa gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazisâ€<9d>. Ukrainian officials said 1,000 Russian servicemen had been killed so far, but warned that advance enemy units had already entered the Obolonskyi district of northern Kyiv. The defence ministry advised residents to â€œprepare molotov cocktailsâ€<9d>. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said the city had entered â€œa defensive phaseâ€<9d>. He added: â€œShots and explosions are ringing out â€¦ and saboteurs have already entered Kyiv. The enemy wants to put the capital on its knees and destroy us.â€<9d> The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia was ready to send a delegation, including foreign and defence ministry officials, to the Belarusian capital, Minsk, for talks with Ukraine, providing the country agreed to demilitarise. Ukraine has said it is willing to discuss declaring itself a neutral county. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, also said Moscow was ready for talks if Ukrainian forces laid down their arms. â€œNo one is planning to occupy Ukraine,â€<9d> Lavrov said, insisting Russiaâ€™s troops were freeing Ukraine from â€œoppressionâ€<9d>. Zelenskiy pleaded with western powers to act faster to cut off Russiaâ€™s economy and provide Ukraine with military assistance. â€œWhen bombs fall on Kyiv, it happens in Europe, not just in Ukraine,â€<9d> he said. â€œWhen missiles kill our people, they kill all Europeans.â€<9d> The west scrambled to respond to Putinâ€™s aggression with a range of fresh sanctions against Moscow, with the US also announcing it would send a further 7,000 troops to Germany to shore up Natoâ€™s eastern borders. There were divisions, however, on the strength of the response. The US president, Joe Biden, and his Nato counterparts sought to reassure member countries on the allianceâ€™s eastern flank, from Estonia to Bulgaria, that their security was guaranteed as Russian forces advanced on Kyiv. â€œRussia has shattered peace on the European continent,â€<9d> the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said as he opened a video summit. â€œMoscow bears sole responsibility for the deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned invasion.â€<9d> The UN security council will also vote on Friday on a draft resolution condemning Russiaâ€™s invasion and requiring an immediate withdrawal â€“ although Moscow can veto the measure and it was unclear how China would vote. The EU on Friday was set to freeze European assets linked to Putin and Lavrov and introduce more measures against Russian banks and industry after facing angry remonstrations from Kyiv for holding back from cutting Russia out of the Swift international payments system through which it receives foreign currency. Zelenskiy earlier on Friday accused Europe of not being hard or quick enough in sanctioning Russia earlier, urging citizens to compel their governments to do more to stop Putinâ€™s invasion. â€œEurope has enough strength to stop this aggression,â€<9d> he said. â€œYou have to act swiftly. We demand effective counteraction to the Russian Federation. Sanctions must be further strengthened.â€<9d> Franceâ€™s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said as he arrived for an EU meeting in Brussels that further sanctions were likely. â€œThis isnâ€™t enough. We need to choke the Russian system and in particular further target the oligarchs,â€<9d> he said. According to a leaked draft of the new sanctions agreed by EU leaders, all members of the Duma, the Russian security council and any Belarusian officials in the military and ministry of defence who â€œfacilitatedâ€<9d> the invasion of Ukraine will be subject to travel bans and asset freezes. Le Maire said, however, that ejecting Russia from Swift, which would have serious economic consequences for leading EU member states including Germany, France and Italy, would be â€œa very last resortâ€<9d>. Beyond the diplomatic arena, Uefa moved the Champions League final to Paris from St Petersburg, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) called on international sports federations to cancel all current or future sporting events in Russia, and Russia was ejected from the Eurovision song contest. The invasion could drive up to 5 million people to flee abroad, UN aid agencies said on Friday, adding that at least 100,000 people are already uprooted in the country and fuel, cash and medical supplies were running low. Streams of people â€“ mostly women and children, since Ukrainian men aged 18-60 are forbidden to leave â€“ crossed into Hungary, Poland and Romania, with 15-hour queues reported at border points. Guards fired warning shots to prevent a stampede at Kyivâ€™s central station as thousands tried to force their way on to evacuation trains. Earlier on Friday, heavy pre-dawn blasts in Kyiv set off a second day of violence after Putin on Thursday defied western warnings to unleash the biggest attack on a European state since the second world war. â€œHorrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv,â€<9d> Ukraineâ€™s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted. â€œLast time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany. Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one.â€<9d> Cleaning broken glass from her room, one Kyiv resident, Oxana Gulenko, said: â€œHow we can live through it in our time? What should we think. Putin should be burned in hell along with his whole family.â€<9d> Witnesses said loud explosions could also be heard in Kharkiv, Ukraineâ€™s second-biggest city, close to the border with Russia, while air raid sirens sounded over Lviv in the west. A resident told the Guardian the eastern city of Sumy had been taken. In the village of Starognativka, near the frontline where separatists have faced off against Kyivâ€™s forces for years, a local official, Volodymyr Veselkin, said missiles had been raining down all morning and the power was out. â€œThey are trying to wipe the village off the face of the earth,â€<9d> he said. Zelenskiy said in a televised address that Putin was targeting civilian as well as military sites. â€œThey say that civilian objects are not a target for them. It is a lie; they do not distinguish in which areas to operate,â€<9d> he said, vowing to continue defending his country and criticising world leaders for â€œwatching from afarâ€<9d>. The international criminal court said on Friday it might investigate possible war crimes, though did not provide any further details. Putin says Ukraine is an illegitimate state carved out of Russia, although his ultimate aims remain obscure. In Russia, thousands of people defied tough anti-protest legislation to stage anti-war rallies across the country on Thursday night. OVD-Info, which monitors arrests at opposition protests, said more than 1,800 people in 59 cities had been detained.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

The report, released by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), analyzed thousands of messages sent to five well known Instagram users: including actor Amber Heard, UK television presenter Rachel Riley, activist Jamie Klingler, journalist Bryony Gordon, and magazine founder Sharan Dhaliwal. Researchers examined a cache of 8,717 messages from the women who participated and say they uncovered a wave of misogynistic abuse, pointing to various ways in which Instagram, owned by Meta, has been â€œnegligentâ€<9d> in addressing the problem. Concerns include the fact that users are unable to report abusive voice notes sent directly to them, that users cannot report messages sent in â€œvanish modeâ€<9d> â€“ when an image is shown just briefly before disappearing â€“ without viewing them, and that users struggle to download evidence of abusive messages. Instagram also allows strangers to place voice calls to women they donâ€™t know over direct message. Faith Eischen, a spokeswoman from Meta, said that when a user receives a voice call on Instagram from someone they do not follow, the call is displayed as a request that must be accepted to hear. You will only receive calls from people you donâ€™t follow after youâ€™ve accepted their DM request. â€œThere is an epidemic of misogynist abuse taking place in womenâ€™s DMs,â€<9d> said Imran Ahmed, CCDH chief executive director. â€œMeta and Instagram must put the rights of women before profit.â€<9d> The messages analyzed in the study were obtained via the Instagramâ€™s data download feature, which allows users to access a record of messages sent by strangers requesting to send them a direct message. However, in some cases participants who had previously blocked abusive users could not access the full â€œrequestsâ€<9d> dataset. Thus, only Rachel Riley, Jamie Klingler, and Sharan Dhaliwal were able to see a full analysis of their direct message history. CCDH said such difficulties in accessing data are not limited to the studyâ€™s participants and mark a broader problem in the quest to address widespread harassment online. Heard, who received â€œerrorâ€<9d> messages when trying to download her own data, said Instagramâ€™s reporting function is â€œnot user friendly, not intuitive, not common sense based.â€<9d> Although the study surveyed the DMs of just a handful of high profile users, researchers say the findings underscore a wider reality for women on the platform, where death threats, harassment, and unsolicited nude videos and images are sent without recourse. Cindy Southworth, Metaâ€™s head of womenâ€™s safety, said that while the company disagrees with â€œmany of the CCDHâ€™s conclusionsâ€<9d> that it does agree â€œthe harassment of women is unacceptableâ€<9d>. â€œThatâ€™s why we donâ€™t allow gender-based hate or any threat of sexual violence, and last year we announced stronger protections for female public figures,â€<9d> she said. Southworth highlighted measures including a separate request inbox for messages from unknown senders and tools to filter messages with common abusive words and phrases. Despite those measures, the CCDH study chronicled dozens of examples of users sending women pornography, nude images of themselves, and pornography edited to feature other faces, known as â€œdeep fakesâ€<9d>, without consent. Aside from the â€œimage-basedâ€<9d> sexual abuse, women also received countless violent messages and more specific death threats. Heard said she frequently receives messages imploring her to kill herself, or threatening her baby â€“ to the extent that she no longer feels safe reading any of her messages. Instagramâ€™s community guidelines bans violence and attacks on anyone â€œbased on their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseasesâ€<9d>. Such messages are supposed to be taken down immediately, but the CCDH study found this often was not the case. The study showed one in every 15 of the thousands of DMs analyzed violated such rules. It also showed that Instagram failed to act on nine in 10 accounts sending violent threats over DM. It is possible that a larger volume of abuse against famous women goes unaddressed, as Instagramâ€™s guidelines do note the platform does â€œgenerally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large public audienceâ€<9d>. But for many users, harassment on Instagram can have a chilling effect. In 2020, the largest ever global survey on online violence found that one in five girls (19%) have left or significantly reduced use of a social media platform after being harassed, while another one in 10 (12%) have changed the way they express themselves. Several women in the study said they no longer feel safe using Instagram. That aversion can have a particularly detrimental effect on the many women who rely on the platform to make a living, including financial and professional connections and sponsorships. â€œDigital spaces provide increasingly important ways to maintain relationships, communicate and build personal brands,â€<9d> Ahmed said. â€œFor women, however, the cost of admission to social media is misogynist abuse and threats sent by abusers with impunity.â€<9d> Meta has in the past taken steps toward removing the accounts of users who send abusing messages. In February 2021 it began to allow users to block abusive accounts from sending further messages for a set period, disabling accounts that repeatedly send abusive DMs, and disabling new accounts created to get around the above measures. But the studyâ€™s participants say this is not enough. Gordon, who has been open about her struggles with eating disorders, said she gets ceaseless abusive messages about her weight. â€œWhen we look back on this period of our completely unboundaried use of social media weâ€™ll look back with the same horror as we do adverts with the Marlboro man saying smoking is good for you,â€<9d> she said.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Iâ€™m Nimo Omer, the assistant editor of First Edition, and Iâ€™ll be with you every Friday. Itâ€™s been a pretty grim week for women. Most visibly, in politics a national newspaper published a story comparing one of the countryâ€™s leading female politicians to Sharon Stoneâ€™s character in Basic Instinct. News broke a few days later that an MP is being investigated after allegations he was watching porn in the Commons chamber. 56 other MPs are under investigation for sexual misconduct. But it isnâ€™t only about the most powerful women in the country. This week the Guardian and BBC published allegations from seven women against former BBC DJ Tim Westwood. He has strenuously denied wrongdoing. All of the women are Black, and some felt that racism would lead people to minimise, dismiss or ignore their claims. So why is it so difficult for these women to be heard? I spoke to the Guardianâ€™s community affairs correspondent, Aamna Mohdin, who worked on the Westwood story, to find out. Before that, a bit of housekeeping. Itâ€™s a bank holiday on Monday, so there wonâ€™t be a newsletter â€“ but take a look lower down for our cultural picks to entertain you this long weekend â€“ and Archie will be back with you on Tuesday. Now, the headlines. Five big stories 1. Ukraine | Last night, Russia attacked Kyiv with two cruise missiles. Ukrainian rescue officials have said the explosions have injured at least ten people and partially destroyed a 25 storey residential building. Click here for all the latest from Ukraine. 2. Ukraine | In one of the largest deployments since the cold war, the UK is set to send 8,000 troops to eastern Europe to combat Russian aggression. The news came as Joe Biden asked Congress for a massive new $33bn US aid package for the country. 3. Race | A non-verbal black 17-year-old was taken to an immigration centre despite never having left the UK. The teenager was incorrectly recorded as Nigerian and recorded as facing â€œimminentâ€<9d> removal from the UK before he was found. 4. Politics | A female MP accused a Labour frontbencher of telling her she would succeed because men wanted to sleep with her. The news came as Boris Johnson faced pressure to act over claims a Tory MP watched pornography in parliament. 5. Brexit | British seaports are considering legal action against the government to recover the costs of unused border control posts after confirmation post-Brexit import checks will be delayed for a fourth time. In depth: What Black women face For a better sense of how the intersections of race and gender affect Black women who make complaints of sexual misconduct, I spoke to Dr Ava Kanyeredzi, a senior lecturer in forensic, clinical and community psychology at the University of East London. â€œBlack womenâ€™s victimisation is never quite believed as valid, because Black women are experiencing racism, colourism â€“ thereâ€™s a lot of forms of abuse and violence that Black women manage in their everyday experiences,â€<9d> she says. She argues that this gets reproduced in the institutions and services that are meant to help them. Here are some of the key barriers: *** Lack of trust Before we even get to the problems Black women face in the criminal justice system, we have to start with the big picture: their lack of faith in public institutions in the first place. â€œThere are huge levels of distrust,â€<9d> Aamna tells me. â€œThey see the violence and trauma that the institutions that are meant to protect them cause in their communities. So the idea that they would go to the police is just laughable to a lot of people.â€<9d> The police isnâ€™t the only route for women who make complaints of abuse: they might turn to charities, social services, or the NHS. But a lot of the time, these services fail to understand the nuances of Black womenâ€™s experiences. â€œWeâ€™ve got a government that doesnâ€™t believe in culturally sensitive services any more,â€<9d> Aamna says. To some on the right, thatâ€™s a punchline. In practice, what it means is finding better ways to help women whose first language isnâ€™t English, or who have precarious legal status, or who have different ideas of what a â€œnormalâ€<9d> family looks like. The Black women Dr Kanyeredzi spoke to for her research â€œfelt betrayed by social work professionals,â€<9d> she said. â€œThese services become places that do not recognise their victimisation. So why would they seek support from a service that they believe is unsafe and doesnâ€™t represent their interests?â€<9d> This lack of trust extends to the media too. When Aamna was reporting her story on Tim Westwood, she had many extended conversations with the women making these allegations. It was a slow, challenging process â€“ and before her sources would open up to her and her colleague Alexandra Topping, they had to earn their trust. *** Generational injustice If the police and the social services often fail the Black women they are meant to help, they are hardly acting in a vacuum, Dr Kanyeredzi says. Generations of bigotry mean that they are less likely to be recognised as possible victims of sexual violence and abuse. â€œBroadly speaking, there are â€˜idealâ€™ typical victims of sexual violence,â€<9d> she said. â€œAnd the ideal typical victims of sexual violence arenâ€™t Black women.â€<9d> This can, and has, manifested in the â€œadultificationâ€<9d> of Black girls, Aamna says: â€œBlack girls particularly just get seen as adults from a really young age.â€<9d> This phenomenon was exemplified recently in a school in Hackney, where a 15-year-old Black girl was strip searched by police, while she was on her period, because her teachers thought they smelt cannabis. *** Access to services and justice All of this makes it difficult for Black women to access the relevant services that should protect and help them. But even when Black women do approach these services, it doesnâ€™t always turn out well. According to data from Refuge, a domestic violence charity, between March 2020 and June 2021, Black women were 14% less likely to be referred to them for support by police than their white counterparts. This is despite the fact that, in that period, Black women were 3% more likely to report abuse. An investigation by National World also revealed that 37 police forces were more likely to bring charges for rape, sexual assault and domestic abuse cases when the person was white. *** The wider context There are other reasons Black women may be reluctant to share their experience. â€œNot only did they think that the institutions would not believe them, they also said that they thought it would backfire quite negatively on them,â€<9d> Aamna said. They may face sexism within their own communities, too, she added. Convictions for sexual assaults, rapes, and other forms of sexual violence are extremely low generally â€“ according to the charity Rape Crisis only one in 100 rapes reported to police result in a charge. If things are already so bad overall, where does that leave Black women? Sport Football | Eintracht Frankfurt beat West Ham 2-1 last night. â€œWe didnâ€™t show enough quality. Sometimes the opposition make it hard for you,â€<9d> said West Ham manager David Moyes. Cricket | Ben Stokes said that it was â€œa real privilegeâ€<9d> to captain England after he was appointed to the job on Thursday. Stokes said that his predecessor Joe Root would be a â€œkey allyâ€<9d> in the team. Football | Liverpool manager JÃ¼rgen Klopp said he is â€œdelighted, humbled, blessed, privileged and excitedâ€<9d> to sign a two-year contract extension with the club. Under Klopp, the team are in the running for an unprecedented quadruple this season. What else weâ€™ve been reading What do we really know about ourselves? Writer and culture critic SinÃ©ad Stubbins asks this question to herself after a friendly encounter with a stranger. Itâ€™s incredibly moving and has left me wondering which personality quirks of mine are real or imagined. Nimo Itâ€™s hard to imagine a more emphatic case for the banning of conversion therapy for trans people than this anonymous writerâ€™s account of the toll it took.

Itâ€™s an infuriatingly good read. Nimo David Simonâ€™s new show, We Own This City, is stuffed with alumni of The Wire, and set in Baltimore, but itâ€™s totally great in its own right.

March is a capricious month, never knowing what it will bring: early sunshine, snow? I think of the months of the year as characters. January is female, and late to motherhood, February her inappropriately indulged first born, who makes all those it comes into contact with miserable. March, the second child, does its own thing and keeps everyone insecure and guessing (the other months are various other members of the family. November is favourite uncle, April is favourite auntâ€¦) Anyway, where was I? The moment I heard about White Rabbitâ€™s Breakfast in Bed bar, Â£3/55g, I knew I had to have it. This sees 56% dark milk chocolate mixed with coffee and feuilletine â€“ pastries and coffee â€“ and it is delicious. It was made ostensibly for Motherâ€™s Day, but ignore that and buy it for yourself whatever your gender and status. Itâ€™s quite simple: if you love coffee, chocolate and flakey croissants youâ€™re going to adore this. White Rabbit is an independent chocolatier in Yorkshire â€“ keen readers may remember I loved its honeycomb chunks last year. This year I canâ€™t get enough of its marshmallow dunkers, Â£3.75, enrobed in milk or dark. Sometimes a chocolate treat just works if it involves almost dislocating your jaw to get it in your mouth. These were made to dunk in hot milk, but I ate them as snacks â€“ in fact, the whole family went at them like a pack of dogs. It was unsightly, but satisfying.

England go into the match third in the table, a point and a place behind Ireland. Defeat would all but end their hopes of topping the pile, with a final-round trip to Paris to come. England have selection headaches with Alex Dombrandt testing positive for Covid-19 last week and not due to train before Thursday and though Sam Underhill is back in the squad, Jones said he was â€œa little bit off his bestâ€<9d>. Tom Curry was, however, able to train on Monday after he was replaced at half-time against Wales with a head injury. Before last yearâ€™s 32-18 loss in Dublin, England had beaten Ireland in four consecutive matches, including two thumping wins in 2019, but Jones highlighted their autumn campaign, in which the All Blacks were emphatically beaten, as a demonstration of their progress. Jones also made mention of how Ireland reap the benefits of having just four provinces to pick from in a system in which the union enjoys far greater autonomy over the domestic sides compared with England. Specifically, Jones believes Irelandâ€™s system is the reason why Johnny Sexton is still their first-choice fly-half at 36 and to further illustrate his point, Leinster have provided at least 10 of Andy Farrellâ€™s starting XV in each of their three matches so far. He also made a pointed reference to the access he gets to his players compared with other nations and while Jones believes that disadvantage is diminished during a World Cup campaign, he claims it puts Farrellâ€™s side in the box seat this weekend. â€œThey are literally, and I say that without any hesitation, the most cohesive side in the world,â€<9d> said Jones. â€œThe bulk of their team train together for the bulk of the year. So they are very well-coordinated in their attack, they are very structured, theyâ€™re very sequenced in set-plays. And theyâ€™re tough around the breakdown. So that poses a great challenge for us. But weâ€™re looking forward to the challenge, weâ€™re not intimidated by any team. â€œIreland are favourites for the game, theyâ€™ve been in very good form in the autumn, theyâ€™re a very settled team, well-coached by Andy Farrell. Weâ€™re in a perfect position, arenâ€™t we? Theyâ€™re flying high, we canâ€™t get our own way or past the barrier according to most journalists. â€œThere are teams that have a head start at the moment, but youâ€™ve got to be good enough to overcome those. We donâ€™t use it as an excuse, we donâ€™t complain about it, worry about it, itâ€™s part of the landscape of English rugby. We can only have 25 players [after] Tuesday, other players can have 42 until Thursday so itâ€™s all different. But once you get to the World Cup campaign start, itâ€™s all equal.â€<9d> Last yearâ€™s heavy loss in Dublin was a surprise in that it came a week after England had impressed in victory over France but Jones revealed that defeat demonstrated the need to press the reset button. Neither Mako nor Billy Vunipola have played for England since â€“ with Jones admitting the leadership group had become too Saracens-centric â€“ while George Ford has appeared only as a replacement. â€œI think it indicated weâ€™d run our race with that group of players, and had to move on,â€<9d> he said. â€œWe came off a good win against France, and had a chance to finish off that tournament well and didnâ€™t do that. That was disappointing. With the Lions tour and the finish to that Six Nations it made it clear we had an urgent need to move the team on.â€<9d> Jones also paid a warm tribute to Shane Warne, the former Australia leg-spinner who died of a suspected heart attack last week, aged 52. â€œI was lucky enough to meet him on a couple of occasions. I remember we had a net session with the Wallabies against the Australian side when they were right at the top of their game and Warne was right at the top. â€œWe had a guy called Wendell Sailor, he was a larger than life character, and he was batting against [Stuart] MacGill who was the other leg spinner. And Wendell was coming in and smashing MacGill out of the nets, and Warney grabbed the ball, he winked to the blokes behind the nets and said â€˜watch thisâ€™. He gave him two and floated them up and he let Wendell smash him and the third one, he bowled a bit shorter, a bit faster, and he was bowled. Then he told Wendell to go where he needs to go! Which I thought was just a great little insight into such a wonderful sportsman.â€<9d> Scotland have called up Adam Hastings for Saturdayâ€™s Six Nations clash with Italy in Rome.

Not if the past near 60 years are anything to go by. The tributes keep coming: Keith Richards, Brian Wilson, Darlene Love, Joan Jett, Elvis Costello. Patti Smith wrote: â€œFarewell, little fireball.â€<9d> Ronnie Spector isnâ€™t just part of rockâ€™nâ€™roll history, sheâ€™s the staples holding it all together. As lead singer of the Ronettes, she was barely out of her teens when she was influencing the influencers. The Beatles courted her. Jimi Hendrix played with her. The Rolling Stones opened for her. She and Richards, for a time lovers, became life-long friends. She was also linked with David Bowie, a long-time admirer. Friends included everyone from Dusty Springfield to Aretha Franklin. Wilson famously had to pull his car over to avoid crashing when he first heard the Ronettesâ€™ 1963 classic, Be My Baby; he went on to listen to it obsessively, declaring it â€œthe greatest record ever producedâ€<9d>. With a heritage that was part-African American, Irish and Cherokee â€“ she grew up in Spanish Harlem, New York City â€“ she ended up embraced across the musical genres, including the New York punks: Smith; Lou Reed; Joey Ramone was a super-fan. Madonna said: â€œI want to look like Ronnie Spector sounds.â€<9d> Amy Winehouse revered and emulated her, from the teetering beehive to the missing-a-skin delivery. So much influence, so eclectically spread, pulsing through the decades. Spector kept working and collaborating throughout her life â€“ Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band, Johnny Thunders, the Misfits â€“ but you get the feeling that, even if sheâ€™d spent the years slumped on a beanbag watching daytime soaps, her influence wouldnâ€™t â€“ couldnâ€™t â€“ have stopped spreading. Is this the essence, the triumph, of Ronnie Spector: that sheâ€™s of the past but not trapped by it? Veronica â€œRonnieâ€<9d> Bennett and the other Ronettes, her sister, Estelle, their cousin Nedra Talley, revolutionised the concept of demure, proto-virginal girl groups: eyes caked with mascara and winged with liner, in heels and tight skirts, they were the unapologetic bad girls, the dirty stop-outs, the glorious walk of shame of 1960s pop. Ronnieâ€™s spirit couldnâ€™t be homogenised or airbrushed away. Her vocals pushed and fought, wildly riding the music. Even embedded in the silvery landscapes of the Ronettesâ€™ most celebrated songs (Be My Baby; Baby, I Love You; Walking in the Rain), she was raw, passionate, distinct â€“ an alley cat sharpening her claws on every note. Itâ€™s this quality â€“ provocation, rebellion, outlaw spirit â€“ that can be sensed filtering through in a diverse slew of later groups and artists, from the Runaways, Chrissie Hynde, TLC, the Bangles, the Go-Gos, Destinyâ€™s Child, B-52s, Neneh Cherry and Poly Styrene, to Pussycat Dolls, Hole, BeyoncÃ© and Solange. Rihanna, Dua Lipa, Cardi B, and Megan Thee Stallion. Ariane Grande nicked her styling and delivery. Billie Eilish, in darker, wittier moments, is a direct Ronnie descendant. Though not everyone is, of course: Adele, for instance, has a direct, emotionally targeted style. Ronnie was different. Sometimes her voice said â€œyesâ€<9d> but her eyes said â€œmaybeâ€<9d> and her attitude said â€œnah!â€<9d>. She was gifted with tonal clarity, but she used it to mess with you. Then there was her spirit. Ronnie spent 15 years wresting back Ronettes money, saying: â€œIt was about winning back me. I gave birth to those songs in the studio.â€<9d> Thus, we come, inevitably, to her first husband and â€œWall of Soundâ€<9d> producer, Phil Spector. An undeniable talent, he was also a major-league controlling abuser. As detailed in her 1990 memoir, Be My Baby, he beat Ronnie, threatened her, isolated her, frightened her by showing her a coffin sheâ€™d be inhabiting if she tried to leave. He surrounded the house with barbed wire, adopted children without telling her, bought her a car and then made her travel with a dummy that looked like him. This appalling abuse, and more, was rendered even darker when Spector was convicted of fatally shooting the actress Lana Clarkson (in the mouth) in 2003, for which he was eventually found guilty of second-degree murder and sent to prison, where he died on this day last year. You might ask: why did Ronnie keep his surname? Well, why not? Sheâ€™d earned her right to use what was essentially her international stage name. Just as itâ€™s a powerful statement to junk an abuserâ€™s surname, arguably so is using it, showing youâ€™re not scared of it. (See also Tina Turner: another who ditched the abuser and kept the name.) What mattered was that Ronnie overcame her own alcohol demons, and escaped, even though Phil Spector hid all her shoes. And that she found lasting happiness with Jonathan Greenfield, who became her manager and with whom she had more children. For all the horror Phil Spector put Ronnie through, for all that they encapsulated a sound together, he never managed to wholly define her, nor subdue or distort her legacy, either as Battered Rock Woman or Interchangeable Songbird. Unsurprisingly, Ronnie was all for feminism and the #MeToo movement. She also publicly supported Taylor Swift when she took on her old record label boss, Scooter Braun, for using her material. Was Ronnie born out of time? Itâ€™s a big question: if she managed to achieve all she did back then in the bad, old (uber-chauvinistic) days, what might she have accomplished now as a 20-year-old? Or maybe she belonged right where she was: dynamic, unstoppable, her appeal straddling the genres, paving the way for the Chrissies and the Pattis, the BeyoncÃ©s and the Amys, the Taylors and the Billies, and whatever spirited lionheart comes next. Itâ€™s the nature of true legend: lightning, not caught in a bottle, not confined, but flashing forward, inspiring new generations. Thatâ€™s the thing about originals like Ronnie Spector: they never date, so they never die. â€¢ Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",FALSE,"pillar/opinion","Opinion"

Iâ€™ll shriek when Iâ€™m scared or startled. Itâ€™s just so natural, it comes right out. This ability to scream was a huge part in getting my first acting jobs. I grew up in New York in the 1980s, where my sister and I had been scouted as child actors. By the time I was seven Iâ€™d got a major role in the film Child of Rage, which meant doing long scenes of shouting and screaming. In the audition I had to perform these outbursts, yelling to show the agony experienced by the character. The film told the true story of a girl who had suffered severe abuse as a child and had what we now understand as reactive attachment disorder: she had never learned love and didnâ€™t know how to have trusting relationships, so acted out violently. On reflection, that film shifted my entire career and personal journey. As a family we moved to Los Angeles so my sister and I could continue working while we finished school. By my 20s Iâ€™d done more than 40 films and TV series. In search of a quieter life, in the late 2000s I made a shift from being an on-camera performer to a voiceover actor. I was lucky to get parts where I was able to really use and play with my voice a lot, and screaming became something that I was known for. You have heard my scream in Free Guy, Paranormal Activity and Scream (2022). My work often comes in at the post-production stage (after filming has taken place). I pick up additional screams and voice acting for the on-camera actors. Sometimes they donâ€™t have the time to achieve the sound the director wants, or I can offer a different vocal quality to the performance. As a scream artist you have to know the subtle differences between screams and determine whether they should peak at certain points, or remain steady for a very long time. I have to think: â€˜OK, the character is scared here, but are they scared because their life is in danger or are they just startled?â€™ Those screams will sound very different. Ghost stories, for example, will often use a shrill, harsh scream because we need the audience to also experience fear. We are like stunt people, doing the hard stuff that could be damaging to an actorâ€™s voice or is out of their range. When the dinosaurs are attacking in the 2015 Jurassic World movie, and you see people running, my screams are in that sequence. When I recorded it, I saw that the characters were grabbing at their hair, falling and then getting up, so I tried to match that and create all of the energy and movement in the sound. We do a wide variety of screams as actors, and thereâ€™s a difference between what we do in reality and what we expect to see on screen. In real life, a lot of people would just suck in their breath and not release any noise when they are frightened, but thatâ€™s not as dramatic when itâ€™s shown on screen. In my own life I happen to be a natural screamer and will let out a scream if Iâ€™m startled. You often think of the classic screams of Fay Wray in King Kong and Janet Leigh in Psycho. Those are beautiful screams, but they are from the damsels. Now, we have a lot more strong rage from women on screen. There are fewer of the â€œterrified femaleâ€<9d> jobs and more for provocateur-type characters. Iâ€™ve been able to witness such a shift in the industry, as women are getting stronger roles where theyâ€™re fighting and baring their emotions â€“ like the female superheroes taking the forefront in action films and television programmes. There are many different screams: of fear, anger, rage. Screams of joy and success, and that raw, embodied scream of female empowerment. Thereâ€™s the wailing of grief and pain, and screams of effort and fighting. The most difficult screams for me are those portraying grief, when youâ€™re watching someone having to express such pain or trauma. Iâ€™m an empathic person â€“ and also hold a PhD in psychology â€“ so I find getting connected with emotion easy, but it also carries a weight with it. Thanks to my unique career, I probably scream more on average than the normal person would. Thereâ€™s something really relaxing about it. After a big day of screaming I feel lighter and brighter. When Iâ€™m not working, I take care of my voice with the typical things like drinking tea, but I did lose it once by getting a little too excited on the rides at Disneyland with my kids. â€¢ As told to Naomi Larsson.

Having earned Baftas for the neo-noir The Beat That My Heart Skipped (2005) and the bone-shaking A Prophet (2010) and won the Palme dâ€™Or with the gripping Tamil-refugee drama Dheepan (2015), Audiard is in altogether more incidental spirits for this bittersweet affair, which flirts with the modern romcom genre while cheekily flipping the themes of Eric Rohmerâ€™s My Night With Maud. The imposing towers of the Olympiades, the high-rise neighbourhood in Parisâ€™s 13th arrondissement from which the film takes its French title, provide the backdrop for an elusively chaptered roundelay of stories. First, we meet Ã‰milie (Lucie Zhang), a Chinese-French science graduate who, despite her qualifications, is kicking her heels in menial jobs such as telesales and waitressing. Ã‰milieâ€™s apartment belongs to her grandmother, who has Alzheimerâ€™s and is now living in a nearby nursing home. Yet Ã‰milie rarely visits, even assuaging her guilt by asking a supposed doppelganger to act as her stand-in, convinced her gran wonâ€™t know the difference. As for her motherâ€™s phone calls from Taiwan, Ã‰milie cuts them short, keeping everything at a distance. When teacher Camille (Makita Samba) presents himself at Emilieâ€™s door as a potential rent-paying flatmate, the pair almost immediately fall into bed. Emilie is smitten, the arrogant Camille less so. â€œWeâ€™re not a couple,â€<9d> he says before bringing home another lover, blithely declaring that â€œattraction fadesâ€<9d> and that: â€œYouâ€™re in love; Iâ€™m not.â€<9d> Next, via an apparently brief detour into the startlingly colourful sex-cam world of Amber Sweet (Jehnny Beth), we hook up with Nora (Portrait of a Lady on Fire star NoÃ©mie Merlant) who has moved from Bordeaux to pick up her studies in Paris. â€œI can see the Seine from my window!â€<9d> she says delightedly before heading to class, where the younger students react dismissively to her thirtysomething presence. Later, a party wig causes Nora to be mistaken for Amber and she promptly finds herself the subject of mobile-phone-powered sex-shaming ridicule. So grotesque is the experience (which Audiard stages with near-gothic inflections) that Nora abandons her studies and becomes an estate agent, a twist that brings her into contact first with the ever-seductive Camille and then, more importantly, with Amber, who proves to be an unexpected soulmate. Audiard describes the stories of American graphic novelist Adrian Tomine from which he drew inspiration as being â€œfilled with whimsy and melancholyâ€<9d>. The same is true of the film, for which Audiard called upon CÃ©line Sciamma, creator of such flawless gems as Girlhood and Petite Maman, and LÃ©a Mysius, who made 2017â€™s Ava, to collaborate on the screenplay. Crisply photographed by Paul Guilhaume, and presented in a romantic urban monochrome that recalls the vistas of Manhattan, this is a playfully sensuous affair that wonders what happens to slow-burn intimacy when mediated by the urgency of the online world. Mobile phones and computer screens are constant companions, bringing people together in strange and unexpected ways, whether itâ€™s the dating apps that Ã‰milie uses to feed her immediate needs or the pay-per-view porn sites through which Nora ironically finds a human connection. Crucially, thereâ€™s nothing judgmental about the script, which takes pleasure in confounding technophobic expectations. While digital communication may allow everyone to live in their own isolated box, itâ€™s interesting how many of the filmâ€™s most genuinely intimate moments play out at one remove. In one scene, a couple â€œsleep togetherâ€<9d> thanks to the miracle of web-cam technology. In another, the thrill of a repeated declaration of love is amplified by being delivered down a door-intercom phone. Hats off to the ensemble cast for making these highly choreographed shenanigans seem as natural as they do and to French electronic music composer Erwan Castex, AKA Rone, who was joint winner of the best soundtrack award at Cannes last year and who provides the bittersweet beat to which Audiardâ€™s film skips.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

Residents of the village of Gilfach Goch, near Bridgend, were woken at 6.50am on Monday when the Â£20m turbine â€“ double the height of Nelsonâ€™s Column â€“ snapped apart and crashed into the valley below. The crumpling of its blades was described as sounding like â€œthunder and lightningâ€<9d> by some who heard it crash down from the 10-turbine Pant y Wal windfarm. Lydia Stephens said: â€œA wind turbine fell over in the windfarm on my village this morning and I thought it was thunder and lighting but how the hell does a wind turbine fall over? â€œApparently it was creaking and banging all night before it collapsed and one woman thought it was her neighbourâ€™s tumble dryer.â€<9d> The windfarm, which opened in 2013, generates enough power for 18,000 homes.

The federal government has handed fracking companies tens of millions of dollars to accelerate exploratory drilling in the basin as part of its â€œgas-led recoveryâ€<9d> from the pandemic, despite evidence that exploiting the regionâ€™s gas would drive up Australiaâ€™s emissions by 13%. Before production can take place, consent must be secured from traditional owners across the vast area that makes up the Beetaloo. The Northern Land Council, tasked with liaising with traditional owners, told a Senate inquiry on Tuesday that it had been promised $2m from the Morrison government to help it consult over the Beetaloo plan. The money, promised in the last federal budget, had so far failed to materialise, the inquiry heard. In fact, the NLC said it had not even received a draft grant agreement for consideration. â€œWe donâ€™t yet have a funding agreement, we have not yet received a draft agreement for our consideration,â€<9d> Greg McDonald, the councilâ€™s branch manager for resources and energy, said. â€œThis was an announcement that was made at last yearâ€™s federal budget, and thatâ€™s where the NLC first heard about it, when that public announcement was made.â€<9d> Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy said: â€œSo weâ€™re coming up to the next budget of the Morrison government, and youâ€™re still waiting on this money, is that right?â€<9d> McDonald responded: â€œThatâ€™s correct.â€<9d> Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The NLC told the inquiry it had already secured consent for exploratory drilling to be conducted in parts of the Beetaloo Basin, but was yet to consult on production more broadly. The inquiry heard that consent was at odds with opposition from a number of traditional owners, including those giving evidence to the Senate inquiry on Tuesday. Ray Dimakarri Dixon, a Mudburra man and traditional owner in the Beetaloo, said the fracking threatened his land and had prompted serious concerns about water, sacred sites, the environment, and his connection to country. â€œFracking uses a lot of chemicals underground and thatâ€™s what we are worried about,â€<9d> he told the inquiry. â€œThis is going to contaminate the water and itâ€™s going to make it bad for our children. It doesnâ€™t matter where we are. It doesnâ€™t matter where we live, what colour, what race, what tribe we are. The water is very important for us â€¦ itâ€™s life.â€<9d> â€œI think we shouldnâ€™t have fracking in our country. Theyâ€™re using our water. Theyâ€™re using our sand. Itâ€™s going to destroy our future, our culture, everything that we have.â€<9d> Lock the Gate, an environmentalist group opposed to fracking, on Tuesday released an analysis of the impact of current and proposed exploratory drilling projects in the Beetaloo, based on the environmental management plans released by proponent companies. It found the exploration activities will use 2,272m litres of water and more than 1m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. The gas industry peak group, Australian Petroleum Exploration and Production Association, told the inquiry that opening up the Beetaloo would create thousands of jobs and increase the supply of gas to both domestic and export markets. â€œThis is both an export and domestic opportunity,â€<9d> APPEA chief executive, Andrew McConville, said. The inquiry heard concerns about the way traditional owners were treated during consultations over fracking. GetUpâ€™s first nations justice director, Larissa Baldwin, said there were instances where traditional owners were not afforded due and proper process, despite fracking companies claiming they had secured consent through the NLC or Central Land Council. â€œWeâ€™ve heard from traditional owners time and time again that on many occasions there has been no process of informed consent,â€<9d> she said. â€œMeetings without translators provided, no detailed description of what will occur, where they will drill and [conduct] production, no information about the long-term impact and the risk to water, health, and cultural heritage.â€<9d> â€œThe communities are not willing to trust these companies on their words.â€<9d> Later on Tuesday, cattle baron Pierre Langenhoven, the director of Rallen Australia, said he did not believe pastoralists and the gas industry could share the basin, saying there was not enough water for the two. â€œThis season we got half the rain we got last year, so already we are starting to muster ... we are trying to prepare for the dry,â€<9d> he said. â€œThe [gas] industry does not care if there is a drought or not because for them the water is limitless.â€<9d> Rallen has six cattle stations in the NT with 70,000 head of cattle in the Beetaloo Basin. It has spent $200m over the past four years developing the properties. â€œThe cattle industry in the NT is very different to any other. It is a very fragile system. People just think you put the cattle out in the bush and pick them up twice a year â€“ that is not the case,â€<9d> he said. With Australian Associated Press",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

With the new season rapidly approaching, the British driverâ€™s future in F1 remains unknown and ostensibly undecided. As the FIA wrestles with an inquiry into the events in Abu Dhabi, it is Hamiltonâ€™s absence that looms over the sport, his silence speaking volumes. Seven times an F1 world champion but beaten to the title in controversial circumstances at the season finale at Yas Marina by Red Bullâ€™s Max Verstappen, Hamilton left Abu Dhabi angry and disillusioned. He believed the race had been manipulated in Verstappenâ€™s favour and so disenchanted was he with the way it had played out, he had lost trust in the rules being applied fairly. His Mercedes principal, Toto Wolff, confirmed shortly afterwards that his future in F1 was in doubt. From Hamilton himself there has been all but nothing since he congratulated Verstappen immediately after that race. He has barely been seen in public and his usually exuberant use of social media has ceased completely. Given his competitive nature, his ability to ultimately overcome and move on from setbacks, it is hard to imagine Hamilton would allow this event, albeit one of crushing proportions, to derail his attempt to take an eighth title this year. F1 insiders are cautiously optimistic that he will indeed return but crucial to that decision will surely be that the 37-year-old has confidence in an even-handed and transparent application of the rules. Hamilton and many of the sportâ€™s fans, also disillusioned by the events in Abu Dhabi, demand a level playing field. Regaining trust in how the sport is run seems paramount and the FIA investigation is key to that. At the heart of the enquiry are the actions of the race director Michael Masi, whose future hangs in the balance. Verstappen passed Hamilton for victory on the final lap after Masi improvised decisions around the rules in order to ensure the seasonâ€™s final race did not finish behind a safety car. There was consternation, confusion and for all that Verstappen was a worthy world champion, distaste and disenchantment for many at how it had happened. Sources inside the FIA insist the sportâ€™s governing body is investigating dispassionately, pursuing a thorough examination of exactly whether the rules were followed. Yet regardless, change is still coming. Peter Bayer is the FIAâ€™s new head of F1, heading the inquiry, and will draw up proposed changes to present to the teams. Last week he admitted that there was a â€œpossibilityâ€<9d> Masi could be replaced. Yet the indications are that this seems unlikely. Certainly at very least there seems widespread agreement across the paddock, within the FIA and confirmed by Bayer that Masi can no longer do the job alone and will need assistants to reduce the burden. Equally there is consensus that safety car rules must be revised, to leave a clear protocol for how it would be used if, as the teams desire, races are not to finish under the safety car and that the ability for team principals to lobby the race director live over the radio as events unfold would be removed. The unseemly impression that barracking from the heads of Mercedes and Red Bull was influencing Masi in Abu Dhabi did F1 no favours in the eyes of many who had simply tuned in to watch drivers not their bosses do battle. Mercedes also remain silent on the subject, focusing on their new car, but the team felt Hamiltonâ€™s pain with the same piercing sense of injustice and without doubt they too will have strong expectations of the FIA presenting not only a clear review of what happened in Abu Dhabi but more importantly that Bayerâ€™s proposals are a blueprint to prevent a repeat of the events. An ambition that should be shared by all, for the sport to draw a line under 2021. The FIA will present its findings to the teams at the F1 commission meeting on 14 February and is expected to make them public shortly afterwards. However should the FIA not do so, it may indicate serious dissent may remain from some participants. Four days after the F1 commission, Mercedes will launch their new car on 18 February when it would be expected they will present Hamilton alongside it, if his mind is made up. When he finally ends the silence it must be hoped it is to confirm he will indeed race on. It is hard not to imagine after all that he will feel there is unfinished business to address but for now all the pressure and the scrutiny lies firmly with the FIA. This is perhaps the greatest and most high-profile test of governance the organisation has faced in more than a decade,it sorely needs to get it right and not only for Hamiltonâ€™s sake. Confidence in the sportâ€™s ability to deliver equitable racing was severely rocked in Abu Dhabi, restoring it will go some way to placating fans who felt entertainment and spectacle had taken precedence over fair play. The sportâ€™s reputation was tarnished and before a wheel is turned in anger this year the furore around 2021 must be put to rest.",FALSE,"pillar/sport","Sport"

One of these found that access to childcare is (surprise, surprise) a huge problem, with childcare black spots existing across Australia. Another report found that children in some centres were going hungry, with some centres allocating as little as 65 cents a day per child for food. Shocking, but what about the findings of a report released by the government itself? The Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS) was asked to evaluate the governmentâ€™s much-lauded Child Care Package. They reported that the package â€“ the Morrison governmentâ€™s major childcare policy measure â€“ is, basically, a dud. The Child Care Package was introduced by the Morrison government in 2018 after an inquiry into the childcare system by the Productivity Commission. It brought into being the Child Care Subsidy, a way of funding childcare that we were assured would be simpler than the previous complex system and would mean cheaper childcare for all. So, what did the evaluation find? Well, firstly it examined whether the Child Care Package made childcare more accessible and flexible. Parents scrambling to find childcare to meet their needs will not be surprised to discover that the answer was nope, it didnâ€™t. It didnâ€™t make childcare more accessible. Analysis of data at the time of the implementation of the CCS and the following 18 months shows no marked changes in access to childcare. There are though large differences in access geographically, and issues for children with additional needs. It didnâ€™t make childcare more flexible either, according to the AIFS. There are mixed levels of parental satisfaction with flexibility. Capacity to change hours received the second-lowest parental satisfaction rating (only above affordability). Other aspects of flexibility were more neutrally rated by parents. These ratings have not changed following the introduction of the Package â€¦ There was little change in the hours for which care was available since September 2018. Next, it examined whether access to childcare support had become simpler. This is the one where those families who have had to spend hours on the phone to Centrelink working out why their childcare fees had suddenly jumped by $400 a week are probably rolling on the floor laughing. Parents were only weakly supportive of the system being easier to understand than the previous system, with the largest group neither agreeing nor disagreeing that the CCS system is simpler. Then it examined if childcare was more affordable. The Australian Institute of Family Studiesâ€™ evaluation found that initially the cost of childcare did drop after the package was brought in. Across all families the Package has reduced the median annual net cost of child care from $2,957 to $2,507 per annum. As a proportion of gross family income, it has fallen from 3.0 per cent to 2.7 per cent. But it also found that the consumer price index showed an 11.8% decline in costs in September 2018 but by March 2020 almost three-quarters of this reduction had been lost. And it found that: Fees charged by services have increased at a similar rate following the introduction of the Package to what they were before the changes. The research also examined if the Child Care Package had made childcare services more viable. In summary, the introduction of the Package appears to have had little impact on the viability of the sector as a whole. So fundamentally, the Morrison governmentâ€™s own report found their â€œbig changeâ€<9d> to childcare funding hadnâ€™t really made childcare more accessible, affordable, flexible or simpler nor led to a more viable childcare sector. Damning stuff really! But surely there must have been some good come out of the package? Did it help parents with children engage in work and education? ABS Labour Force Survey data, surveys of parents conducted for the evaluation and child care system administrative data show small increases in parental activity, including employment, since the Package was introduced. However, these increases are not inconsistent with increases over a period of years. What about ensuring vulnerable and disadvantaged children could access childcare? The introduction of the Package has had little impact on the overall use of child care among low and lower middle income families â€¦There is no clear pattern on access for population subgroups, including those at a higher risk of vulnerability. Surely the introduction of the package at least made childcare funding more sustainable for government? There is little evidence of any changes to the economic fundamentals of child care provision. The executive summary of the AIFSâ€™s report says: More broadly, the evaluation notes there are significant challenges in the provision of early childhood education and care, including the balance between child care as an enabler of parental workforce participation and the role of early childhood education and care in child development and as an instrument to address disadvantage. Isnâ€™t it time that the screams of parents of young children and of the educators and early childhood teachers are heard? They are the ones that have been saying this exact same thing for decades. They have been saying that our childcare (early education and care) system just doesnâ€™t work, and it is really about time we need a government that might actually do something about the mess. You know, rather than what the current government has done â€“ introduce a Child Care Package that when evaluated is found to have achieved bugger all. Apparently childcare funding reform is just another Morrison government policy failure.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Iain Henderson starts for the first time in the second row, although he played all but the first 82 seconds against England, after James Ryanâ€™s withdrawal with a head injury from the incident that saw Charlie Ewels sent off. Elsewhere, Jack Conan returns at No 8, with Caelan Doris reverting to flanker, meaning Peter Oâ€™Mahony steps back to the bench. These are simply adjustments from a position of strength, which highlight the depth of options available to Farrell. Further evidence of this can be found in the three-quarters. Andrew Conway makes way for Mack Hansen because of a knee injury, but Hansen had been one of the stars of Irelandâ€™s first three rounds, which also happened to be his first three Tests. Then Conway was given a run for the pivotal Twickenham showdown last week and emerged as one of Irelandâ€™s best performers. All of which begs the question, why is Irelandâ€™s fate in the hands of others? To which one reply might be, the first five minutes of their 30-24 defeat in Paris. Or another might be, inaccuracy at crucial moments later in the game. It may be harsh to criticise Ireland unduly for falling victim to the same brilliant opening by the French that the other home nations have suffered so far, but â€“ again like the others â€“ they worked their way back into contention without quite finishing the job. Farrell will be as frustrated as millions of others by the red cards that placed asterisks next to the two wins that followed. Red cards might not â€œruinâ€<9d> matches, whatever that means, but they transform their dynamics, affecting the mindset of everyone, including the team who benefit, and artificially compromising the elemental question in sport of which team has played better. Irelandâ€™s wins in rounds three and four, against 13 and 14 men respectively, were of the job-done variety, but Farrell will have wanted tests more meaningful by which to gauge the reaction to defeat in Paris. Will Ireland have that opportunity in the final round against Scotland? Assuming no further red cards, which is a dangerous presumption these days, a casual observer could be forgiven for thinking not. The cold, hard facts show Scotland have not won in Dublin since 2010. And that was at Croke Park. They have not won at Lansdowne Road since 1998. In the 11 Six Nations encounters since 2010, Scotland have won twice, the last five years ago. There is something about the meaty substance of recent Ireland teams that Scotland do not respond well to, even when they are not coping with the crushing disappointment of another championship gone by. Their headline selection for this one is that of Blair Kinghorn at fly-half. This is accommodated by the dropping of Finn Russell. Gregor Townsend is at pains to underplay the significance of the selection, but it is impossible not to speculate whether this marks a change in policy, an attempt to break from the most recent characterisation of Scotland as brilliant but brittle. Russell has time yet to make the transition from genius fly-half into a match-shaping one, which some greats achieve in their later years. He and Townsend, who managed that metamorphosis himself, have not always seen eye to eye. Now Scotlandâ€™s coach turns to the elegant Kinghorn, more usually a full-back or winger in the past. There is something about him of Stephen Larkham, another who made that transition, albeit from the position of brilliant full-back. Whether Scotland start to make the shift to a consistently winning team in Dublin this weekend feels unlikely. If Ireland win, it would be over to Paris, where defeat for France would see Farrellâ€™s side crowned champions.",FALSE,"pillar/sport","Sport"

But his joke reflects a growing concern that polyester clothing is an environmental hazard. To start with, virgin polyester is derived from fossil fuels, and as the technology stands, recycled polyester is more accurately downcycled plastic. The process takes bottles out of a closed loop system and degrades them so they canâ€™t be recycled again. These environmental challenges are compounded during use. Polyester is a smelly, sweaty, stain-prone material that sheds plastic microfibres when it is washed and worn. But, because itâ€™s cheap, itâ€™s in more than half our clothes. Since itâ€™s very likely we all have something made from polyester in our wardrobes, here is some expert advice on how to minimise its impact. Letâ€™s start with microfibres Microfibres are tiny particles that break off our clothes when we wash and wear them. Velina Karadzhova, the head of First Sentier MUFG Sustainable Investment Institute, says theyâ€™ve â€œbeen found in air, rivers, oceans, soils, tap water and human food such as fish and vegetablesâ€<9d>. To make matters worse, since synthetic materials donâ€™t break down in natural environments, microfibre pollution is accumulating. Paul Servin, the applications development director at Xeros Technology Group, says â€œaround one third of all primary microplastic pollution comes from washing our clothes in the washing machineâ€<9d>. Small changes to the way you do laundry can help Rebecca Van Amber, a textile scientist from RMIT university, says you can significantly reduce microfibre shedding by making simple changes to your laundry. She suggests using a liquid detergent and lower water temperature, switching to a front-loader washing machine and, instead of tumble drying your clothes, hanging them out to dry. According to Servin, washing garments in a full load of laundry can reduce shedding by up to five times. He also recommends washing garments less often and says: â€œTry and consider if the garments need washing or if they can be cleaned in other ways.â€<9d> Get a washing machine filter Servin says having your washing machine fitted with a microfibre filter is the most effective way to prevent microfibres from wash cycles entering the environment. The latest filter developed by Xeros, called the XFiltra, can capture more than 90% of microfibre pollution. In recognition of the scope of the problem, governments are moving to make microfibre filters a requirement on washing machines. In Australia, the National Plastics Plan aims for â€œan industry-led phase-in of microfibre filters on new residential and commercial washing machines by 1 July 2030â€<9d>. There is similar legislation being drafted in the UK and France. Use a Guppyfriend bag Another way to prevent microfibre pollution is by using a Guppyfriend bag. Place your polyester or synthetic garments inside it during washing. Studies show the bags reduce the amount of shedding and catch microfibres that do break off. But, Servin says, be mindful of how you dispose of microfibres caught inside the bag. â€œThe temptation would be to rinse it out under a tap, which would defeat the object.â€<9d> Experts say the safest thing is to put them in the bin. Different fabrics shed at different rates Another thing to keep in mind is that different fabrics shed microfibres at different rates. Karadzhova says polyester sheds about three times more than nylon, while fabrics from mixed materials also appear to shed less than fabrics made from 100% polyester. Textile weave should be factored in too, Van Amber says, to avoid â€œfabrics which are fluffy and pillâ€<9d> because this is visible evidence of microfibre shedding. A good example is fleece fabrics that have a brushed surface and raised fibres. She says these fabrics are â€œmuch more likely to shed fibres than yoga pantsâ€<9d> because smooth stretchy materials are made of longer fibres that have less threads protruding and so are less susceptible to shedding. Move quickly to prevent odours and stains Since polyester is plastic, it has a complicated relationship with sweat and oil. Which is to say, it holds on to both and wonâ€™t let them go. Thatâ€™s why polyester starts to smell and why stains on polyester can be impossible to wash out. â€œAny stain should be treated as quickly as possibleâ€<9d> because if it has time to dry and set, it will be much more difficult to remove, Van Amber says. â€œGently blot an oil stain with soap or detergent and water immediately.â€<9d> Sweat stains should also be moved on quickly to prevent odour from setting in. Van Amber says polyester fabrics with a looser weave or knit structure should be more resistant to odours. This is because â€œthe gaps and spaces between the fibres and yarns facilitates air flow through the fabric.â€<9d> On the other hand, fabrics with a very tight weave should be more resistant to staining because â€œany liquid spilled on it will land as a dropâ€<9d> and the tightness of the structure should delay the drop being absorbed. Finally, be aware of polyester or synthetics claiming to have antimicrobial and anti-odour capabilities. Studies show that while they can control bacteria, they do not control smell.",FALSE,"pillar/lifestyle","Lifestyle"

But does the naming of storms heighten awareness to the danger, or inure us? Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society, says that it does work and heightens awareness. â€œHaving named storms gives them a kind of uniqueness, identity and higher profile â€¦ that need for people to listen and take action.â€<9d> The naming of storms in the UK and Ireland is a recent phenomenon, although it has been used around the world for decades. But in 2015 the UK Met Office and Irelandâ€™s Met Ã‰ireann launched the Name our Storms project to improve communication of high-impact weather events. The public are invited to suggest names for the storms and a list of alternate male and female names is issued in September. Last year it began with Arwen and if there is a storm later this week it will be Gladys. Future names include Imani, Nasim, Ruby and Tineke. The naming of storms comes on top of the system in which the Met Office issues yellow, amber and rare red warnings. Bentley accepted that having so many weather warnings could inure people to their danger. â€œIâ€™ve heard people say: â€˜We always have warnings and people become blase about them.â€™ But they are there for a reason.â€<9d> People will only become blase, Bentley believes, if they stop believing them. â€œThe worst thing that could happen is that we push out lots of these warnings and then nothing happens. Thereâ€™s that feeling of weâ€™re crying wolf.â€<9d> She said the Met Office had done an impressive job in naming Eunice last Monday. â€œTo get that message out five days in advance is pretty good going.â€<9d> Named storm warnings work, said Bentley, pointing to the 22 lives lost in the â€œgreat stormâ€<9d> of 1987, which came through when most people were asleep. Eunice was during the day and three people in the UK were killed. â€œAny loss of life is terrible but it could have been an awful lot worse.â€<9d> The pioneer of storm naming as we know it was a meteorologist called Clement Wragge, who worked for the Queensland government between 1887 and 1907. It was adopted by US navy and air force meteorologists during the second world war for the naming of tropical cyclones and became common practice in the US and Australia from the 1950s. Andrew Charlton-Perez, professor of meteorology at Reading University, was part of a team that explored the impact of naming storms by looking at Storm Doris, which took place in 2017, and how information flowed. â€œYou can definitely see very large spikes in attention around that term a couple of days before the event, there really is communication going on.â€<9d> Naming Storm Eunice so far in advance â€œreally did change behaviourâ€<9d>, he said. â€œBoth the warnings and storm naming is all about changing behaviour and making sure that people donâ€™t put themselves at risk so I think yes absolutely, that worked in this case.â€<9d> He praised the Met Office for making the right calls at the right time, meaning people took note. â€œYou can end up with doing this too much and people get inured to it.â€<9d> So far, that was not happening, he said.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Standard agonies. Sweet or savoury? Liquid or something to munch? I opted for Doritos, keying in a three-digit code and touching my card to the reader so that the packet moved jerkily forwards, propelled by a churning plastic spiral and tipped into the well of the machine. My Doritos landed with a thwap, a sound that always brings relief to the vending enthusiast, because there hasnâ€™t been a mechanical miscue. Judged by the clock, which now read 12am, it was the UKâ€™s first vending-machine sale of the day. Nine hours later, I was sitting in a spruce office in the Manchester suburb of Wythenshawe, drinking coffee with John â€œJohnny Brodâ€<9d> Broderick, the man who owned and operated that handsome airport machine. Iâ€™d had an idea to try to capture 24 hours in the life of vending machines. These weird, conspicuous objects! With their backs against the wall of everyday existence, they tempt out such a peculiar range of emotions, from relief to frustration, condescension to childish glee. For decades Iâ€™d been a steady and unquestioning patron. I figured that by spending some time in the closer company of the machines and their keepers, by immersing myself in their history, by looking to their future, I might get to the bottom of their enduring appeal. What made entrepreneurs from the Victorian age onwards want to hawk their goods in this way? What made generations of us buy? Johnny Brod seemed a good first person to ask. Freckle-tanned, portly and quick to laugh, Broderick has a playful exterior that conceals the fiery heart of a vending fundamentalist. He is a man so invested in the roboticised transmission of snacks that, come Halloween, Johnny Brod has been known to park a machine full of sweets in his driveway, letting any costumed local kids issue their demand for treats via prodded forefinger. With his brother Peter and his father, John Sr, he runs the vending empire Broderickâ€™s Ltd, its 2,800 machines occupying some of the most sought-after corridors and crannies of the UK. The Broderick family sugar and sustain office workers, factory workers, students, gym goers, shoppers and schoolchildren. They pep up breaktimes in a nuclear power station. If youâ€™ve ever wolfed a postpartum Snickers in the maternity ward at Chesterfield or Leeds General, or turned thirsty while waiting to fly out of Stansted or Birmingham airports, then youâ€™ve almost certainly shopped, at one mechanical remove, with Johnny Brod. He thanks you. The coffee we drank that morning had trickled into cardboard cups from one of his own hot-beverage makers. Business had been hurt badly by Covid, he said. There had been one wretched day in the spring of 2020 when he awoke to find himself not the owner of the second-largest fleet of vending machines in the UK, but instead, of â€œtimebombs. All these machines of ours in places we couldnâ€™t access. All full of perishable food.â€<9d> After enduring months of closed workplaces, abandoned airports and dead campuses, the Brodericks had lost millions on foregone Twirls and Mini Cheddars. Even so, Johnny Brod was bullish, insisting that the pandemic presented him with opportunities, too. As he led me on a tour of his Wythenshawe headquarters, I told him about my early hours purchase from a Broderick machine at the airport. Talk about a smooth transaction, I said. No snagging! I imagined he would be pleased to hear this, but he twitched his head in frustration, as if at a grave breach of etiquette. Vending people hated it, he explained to me, this unexamined expectation of mechanical failure. Modern machines contained many failsafes against botched vends. Despite this, the one time that Johnny Brod could remember his beloved industry trending on Twitter, a cruel joke had done the rounds. â€œAbout change being inevitable. Except from a vending machine.â€<9d> Every one of his machines, he countered, was fitted with a contactless card reader. Since Covid, people didnâ€™t want to touch anything they didnâ€™t have to. Big change was sweeping through automated vending, and the first thing to go was small change. As cash sales tumbled in 2020 and 2021, and contactless sales climbed, the Brodericks had been the beneficiary of new and better information about their customers. Pre-Covid, not only did they have to go and fetch someoneâ€™s coppery quid, then count it â€“ they didnâ€™t even know whose quid it was. Now the tycoons of vending understood us better. Johnny Brod had released a smartphone app that tempted people with discounts in return for permission to track their vending habits. He led us into a control room that had large screens mounted on the walls and employees arranged Nasa-style, facing screens on which stationary dots and travelling arrows identified thousands of vending machines and the technicians who roved between them. We watched a live ticking record of the dayâ€™s sales activity, north to Aberdeen, south to the Isle of Wight. A couple of quick clicks on a technicianâ€™s computer and we were marvelling at the snacking history of a loyal, I would say fanatical, Broderick customer in Manchester, someone who must have been sourcing two full meals a day from behind glass. While Johnny Brod made a note to slip this customer a thank-you tenner via the app, I asked his team if theyâ€™d be able to find the record of my midnight Doritos. A few keyboard taps and there it was. The Doritos fell from their spiral at midnight, closely followed by a sachet of peanut M&amp;Ms, a stubby Mars and a bottle of water. What happened next in the wider world of these machines? I contacted a number of Johnny Brodâ€™s competitors, outfits of all sizes, and asked them to share with me similar sales data for that day in July. I enlisted volunteers to help me track vending activity around the globe. Everywhere mouths watered, spirals turned. A world of people bent double, their hands patting blindly inside retrieval wells, claiming juice boxes, cola bottles, cereal bars, gum, whatever theyâ€™d bought, whatever they craved. * * * At 12.45am, a white-chocolate Twix dropped into the well of a machine in Blackfriars in London. At a taxi depot in Belfast, drivers on overnight standby thumbed in coins to buy keep-awake Cokes. Cans of sugar-free Tango slammed down in the surgeonsâ€™ staffroom at an Edinburgh hospital. Bottles of Mountain Dew, already long past expiry, turned another hour older inside a Covid-shuttered office in North Carolina. A Japanese accountant, several hours ahead of Europe and the US in a southern prefecture called Ehime, eyed the familiar choices in a cup-noodle machine by his desk. At 4.14am, UK time, a night owl in Newcastle bought Haribo. As the sun rose on Dundee, an employee at a packing factory turned the Perspex carousel of a chilled food machine, sliding back a sprung door, choosing for breakfast a shrink-wrapped sausage roll. At 7.31 am, on a train-station platform in Wakefield in West Yorkshire, a machine was tapped for Tango Orange as the first morning commuters came through. Wakefield is the birthplace of automated vending. This is where the world began its determined effort to uproot the salesperson from the sale. In the 1850s, an inventor here patented a â€œself-acting machineâ€<9d> for the dispensation of stamps. Later, in the 1880s, a cast-iron contraption shaped like a trident and painted post-box red, patented by the Sweetmeat Automatic Delivery Company of London, was the first machine to vend comestibles. Before the end of the century, beer and wine fountains became fashionable in Paris. In the US, gumball machines sprouted everywhere. British law dictated that tobacconists must close their doors at 8pm, so unattended cigarette dispensers were bolted to the pavements outside. As the social historian Kerry Segrave notes in her 2002 book, Vending Machines, the moment these â€œsilent salesmenâ€<9d> appeared on the streets, they were viewed as fair game to be swindled. Tricking vending machines was called â€œsluggingâ€<9d>, because you fed in cheap brass slugs instead of money. Hundreds of worthless metal lozenges advertising boot polish were found inside a single machine in south-west London in 1914. More than a century later, Johnny Brod told me that sluggers were still at large, only these days they tended to use counterfeit currency. He once had a shoebox full of recovered dud coins in his Wythenshawe office, but it was stolen during a break-in. Back in 1926, the battle against the cheats brought the Fry family into vending. And the Fry family changed the whole game. BE Fry was an inventor in St Louis, Missouri, who noted that the machines in his city were gullible enough to be fooled by cardboard circles. He came up with an improved coin-swallowing mechanism that would answer to nickels and dimes or nothing, he swore. By the 1940s, Fryâ€™s family business, renamed National Vendors, was booming. National Vendors established many of the industry customs that hold sway today. Roving technicians on the roads. A sales team on the phones back at HQ, fighting off turf incursions from rivals, signing new sites to new contracts. Every vending machine is a battleground. Profits are ruthlessly haggled over. Competition for spots is intense. Broadly speaking, the vending game is built on deals between operators (who own machines and have the skills to install them, fix them, constantly fill them with fats and sugars) and site owners (who have the rights to advantageous pieces of land). Either a machine is placed on private property â€“ say, a factory, where the site owner surrenders profits to the operator in return for keeping a workforce fed and present â€“ or, a machine is placed somewhere public, inside a teeming airport, for instance. Here the site owner will expect a cut of each item sold, anywhere from 10% to 30%. Those midnight Doritos at Manchester airport cost me Â£1.10. Though Johnny Brod, the operator, would not say how much of a cut went to the site owner, Manchester Airports Group, he did acknowledge that he made 22p in profit per Doritos packet. (And that Manchester Airport Group made more.) We were discussing this in headquarters when his father, John Sr, wandered through the office, ready to reminisce about the old days. John Sr explained how he founded the business in the 1960s with a single National Vendors machine, imported from the US. He struck a deal to put it in the foyer of Macclesfield baths. Everything escalated from there. As the Broderick business grew, the family watched their rivals big and small start to eat each other. For the past 20 years or so, global vending has been dominated by corporations that have carved up the world into domains, buying and absorbing regional operators. The big fish in Japan is a vending company called Glory. In the US, itâ€™s Crane. Europe is ruled by Selecta, founded in Zurich in 1957 and owned by the Swiss private-equity firm KKR since 2015. From its English outpost in Hemel Hempstead, Selecta bosses the UK market, with 80,000 machines scattered around hotels, transport hubs and petrol stations. On more than one occasion, Johnny Brod said, heâ€™d received speculative phone calls from Selecta about the possibility of a buyout. But the Brodericks always told Selecta no. Unfinished business. As Johnny Brod explained to me in the Wythenshawe office, the post-pandemic world was one that needed feeding to an ever-greater degree by unmanned food stations. He had secretive concept sketches on his phone, and prototype machines behind a locked laboratory door at his headquarters, all part of a plan to help usher in a new vending age. I made him promise to show me the secret lab after lunch. * * * Lunchtime. In Belfast, that same day, Emmet Oppong walked into a taxi depot near his home carrying as many Cokes as he could handle. He also had pouches of midget gem sweets, massive Twix Xtras and three types of Wrigleyâ€™s gum. Weeks earlier, this 21-year-old business graduate had become the owner of a beige and somewhat time-ravaged vending machine that was, in fact, a little older than Oppong himself. He bought it from an online broker for Â£100 and had since spent about Â£500 trucking it around, renting storage space, pondering locations, till he found it a home among the taxi drivers. Oppong unlocked the machineâ€™s front and began to feed in packets and cans. He was drawn to vending because he liked the idea of earning money while he slept, ate, studied, interviewed for other jobs, and in general applied his energies elsewhere. Ignoring for a moment the fierce battle for plots, the maintenance stresses, the logistical feats required to keep far-flung machines stocked and clean, at the core of any vendorâ€™s ambition there is often a dream of becoming rich while doing better things. This dream is not always achievable. The second-, third-, fourth- and fifth-hand machines being sold online are a testament to the many dabblers who plunge in only to beat an eventual retreat. But Oppong was doing alright so far. A few more midget gems sold, a bit more gum, and soon he expected to break even on his Â£600 investment. Perhaps today. Before that summer, Oppong had never looked inside a vending machine or wondered how they functioned. Then he became the owner of a model called a SnackMart, which came to him wrapped in dusty cellophane, with alien interior workings. He spent a fortnight in a storage unit, stood before the machine with an ownerâ€™s manual in hand, trying to distinguish what from what. He learned that â€œspacersâ€<9d> were clamps that kept slender items, such as drinks cans, snug in their rack. â€œProduct expellersâ€<9d> were slip-on tongues for the spirals that helped send puffier items such as crisps on their reluctant drops to the well. An evaporation unit above the door sucked in moisture and stopped the glass from steaming over. Though the outer facades of vending machines have become jazzier, and payment methods have modernised, the insides of most vending machines have barely changed in decades. Oppong followed certain fundamental laws of vending. He put his Twix Xtras and some Maltesers down on the bottom shelves, nearest the SnackMartâ€™s fridge unit. Crisps were placed in the warmest part of the machine, up at the top. The midget gems could go anywhere, really, and today he decided to give them a try in primetime â€“ halfway along, halfway up. In vending, this part of the job, as delicate as flower arrangement, is known as planogramming. How best to spread the wares? Fiona Chambers, who runs the vending company SV24-7 in the Scottish town of Alloa with her husband, Ian, puts much thought into planograms. She told me she likes two central spirals of KitKats, two of Twirls, these being her champion sellers. Declan Sewell, the young and ambitious CEO of a company called Decorum Vending in Portsmouth, will always, always put Snickers in the middle. Sewell told me he preferred to keep more colourfully packaged items on the fringes of his machines, to catch the eye and draw attention across his range. If the glass or Perspex window of a vending machine is like a canvas, these operators aimed to paint a picture of abundance. â€œYou donâ€™t want the customer saying, och, thereâ€™s nothing to choose from,â€<9d> Chambers said. At the same time, margins being tightest for operators in the industryâ€™s middle tier, she and Sewell couldnâ€™t afford to fill their machines so generously that items expired before they were bought. Certain planogramming wheezes mitigated against this. Items put close to a button panel, Sewell insisted, sold quicker than items below or above. Chambers had read an academic study that claimed to prove options on the left outsold options on the right, at least in Europe and the US, because we read these machines how we read our books. Oppong closed the front of his SnackMart, locking it carefully. The names given to vending machines are reliably charming, sometimes hinting at their places of manufacture. Spain makes Mistrals. The US makes Cascades. Germans make Bistros! (exclamation mark included). Italian machines tend to be given musical names: Operas, Melodias, Sinfonias, Jazzes. There are machines out there called Shoppers, Shoppertrons, SuperStacks, NarrowStacks. There are Brios, Astros, Tangos, Sambas, Festivals, Visions. There are BevMaxes, Polyvends, Merchants â€“ and SnackMarts, which were created by a British engineer called Richard Brinsley and his company Westomatic. â€œWestâ€<9d>, for their west-of-England base, â€œomaticâ€<9d> because what do you think. I went to visit Brinsley one day at his workshop in Devon. In a part of one warehouse, malfunctioning SnackMarts were lined up for repair, while other, sadder machines, like a miserably rusted Kenco dispenser, were beyond salvation and awaited final destruction. Something of a pioneer when it came to vending English tea, Brinsley was the first to bring to market a machine that brewed from leaves, not powder, in the 1980s. He called that creation the Temprano, â€œbecause it was ahead of its timeâ€<9d>, Brinsley told me. He led us into a part of the warehouse where a brand new hot-drinks dispenser was coming into being. â€œWeâ€™re going to call this one the Autorista,â€<9d> he said, as he stood in front of a huge purple machine, the first in the world, according to Brinsley, that could prepare a coffee with real milk or real cream. â€œOne of our electronics guys came up with the name,â€<9d> he said, hitting a few buttons and automatically barista-ing out a cappuccino that contained fresh cowâ€™s milk. Johnny Brod in Manchester, obsessional about new kit, had placed an order for the first 25 Autoristas that Brinsley could manufacture. In order for this latest innovation to be effective in the field, both men knew, an Autorista would have to be visited every 24 hours by a technician who knew how to clean its interior pipes and flush out the old milk and cream before it soured. If this was the future of unattended sales, I thought out loud, it was going to require a lot more human attention than in the past. But leaving the Autorista alone and full of spoiling dairy did not bear thinking about, Brinsley said. Over in Belfast, Oppong had the option of leaving his SnackMart to take care of itself for weeks at a time. Out of sheer enthusiasm, he had been visiting the taxi depot almost every day. He popped in mornings and nights, to feed in new stock and to pull out the coin tray, relishing the weight of the driversâ€™ one- and two-pound coins. Declan Sewell of Decorum Vending had rigged his own fleet with wifi units so that he could track his live sales by smartphone, refreshing for updates like a fan following the Saturday football. Fiona Chambers in Scotland relied on reports that came nightly by email. Oppong was still tracking profits with a pen and paper. He tallied the latest. Nearly there. * * * A few timezones west, the US awoke, its 7 million vending machines getting busier and busier as another working day began. An IT analyst in North Carolina, returning to his office for the first time since the start of the pandemic, decided to buy a Mountain Dew from the break-room machine. He noticed when it was too late that the bottle had expired 16 months earlier, in March 2020. â€œIf I die,â€<9d> the analyst tweeted, opening the Dew anyway, â€œjust know I died doing what I love.â€<9d> I got in touch with him. He survived. His drink was only a little flat. Vending machines do kill their human patrons every so often. A US study in 1998 recorded 37 deaths and 113 injuries over a 20-year period, which amounted to an average of 1.85 kills per annum. This statistic, never formally updated or corrected since, sometimes prompts the claim that vending machines are deadlier than sharks. In the 1980s, cans of drink were left for the taking on top of vending machines near Hiroshima in Japan. These cans had been deliberately laced with a potent herbicide. Twelve people died and their killer was never caught. Vending machines can be vessels for all manner of plots, ambitions and initiatives. In Glasgow, that same day in July, health officials unveiled a free-to-use dispenser of sterilised needles, an attempt to curb infections among the cityâ€™s drug users. At the same time, over in California, the porn actors Carmela Clutch and Kyle Mason debuted a film that had for its setting the patch of ground in front of a sex-toy dispenser. Carmela had her hand stuck in the flap. Kyle, as an arriving technician, caught a vibe. The scene developed from there. While I was in Manchester I read news reports about a civic effort in Nairobi to put sanitary-pad dispensers in schools. A similar scheme was announced for womenâ€™s restrooms in Tokyo, where, that same day, hundreds of journalists were flying in ahead of the Olympic Games. On arrival at Tokyoâ€™s Olympic Village, international guests were offered the chance to buy locally apt souvenirs in a locally apt way, via robotic vend. If Wakefield is the literal birthplace of the automated sale, Japan is the spiritual home. There they vend umbrellas, ice-cream, fancy dress. In Nagasaki, there is a machine that sells the edible chrysalises of silkworms. You can vend fresh tomatoes in Kobe and, in Tatsuno, fresh oysters. In Osaka, during the summer of 2021, a Japanese airline had started selling tickets to mystery destinations from a machine that asked 5,000 yen, or Â£30, per turn. This concept was so popular that 10,000 tickets were sold by the end of 2021 and the airline put duplicate machines in Tokyo, Nagoya and Fukuoka. At the last formal count, conducted by a trade body in December 2020, there were 2.7m vending machines spread around Japan: one for every 46 citizens, the highest density anywhere. Affection for vending is so pronounced that a machine selling something unique may become the subject of fascination, even pilgrimage. On 21 July, while I was in Manchester with the Brodericks, and while Emmet Oppong was keeping a close eye on his Belfast machine, a Japanese accountant named Masaharu Mizota was coming to the end of his day in Ehime. Mizota had recently learned about an unusual, indeed, one-of-a-kind machine in Uchiko, a small town on the Oda River, and he daydreamed about taking a roadtrip to try it. Would it be crazy to drive for hours to Uchiko, just to push a coin into a slot and punch a few buttons? Vending machines have the power to beguile a certain type of person. As I am one of those types, wandering up to scuffed Perspex wherever it is to be found, often overpaying in this way for my Boosts or my ready salted crisps, Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time wondering about their hypnotic power. There is a logic that underpins the will to vend to other people. Itâ€™s that allure of passive income. The operator of a vending machine gets to experience the idle fancy of exhausted shopkeepers everywhere, selling their wares without getting up early in the morning, without necessarily getting up at all. But what is behind the will to be vended to? This is more complicated. I think it has something to do with the proffered combination of convenience, novelty and nostalgia. Mizota told me that he felt the culture of automated vending to be a part of his culture as a Japanese citizen. He was as willing to take a long journey to try out a novel machine as he would have been to visit a monument or a place of natural beauty. Mizota was eight hours ahead of me in the UK, almost ready to go to bed. Before he did so he checked his maps, figuring out a route for the morning. * * * In Manchester it was mid-afternoon. Leading me into a room at his headquarters that he called his concept lab, Johnny Brod waved an arm at a pair of unplugged prototypes. â€œMy babies,â€<9d> he called them. His actual children and even a couple of grandchildren happened to be visiting that day. If everything went according to plan, Johnny Brod said, these prototypes would secure his familyâ€™s fortune long into the future. He was nervous about me repeating specific details, lest his competitors gain a jump. But the gist of what Johnny Brod was plotting went as follows. Many workplace canteens, closed during the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021, had not reopened, or not at their former scale. For reasons of in-house virus management, employers were no longer so eager to have employees roam out at lunch to the nearest sandwich shop or supermarket. Those high-street retailers still wanted to reach a hungry workforce, however, and Johnny Brod hoped to become the bridge. He wanted to run new-wave machines of his own design inside offices and factories, as one-stop robotic canteens. There was a prototype up and running in the distribution centre of a well-known UK retailer, from which the Brodericks vended salad bowls, fruit bowls, â€œanything youâ€™d see in a garage forecourt. Soon weâ€™ll be diversifying into sushi. CruditÃ©s!â€<9d> These manoeuvrings were part of a wider shift that had been taking place across the vending industry for a decade. Back in the early 2010s, innovators in the US came up with an alternative to the traditional spiral machines that they called micro-markets. Take out its turning coils, leave in the shelves, and a vending machine is essentially a transparent larder. What if customers could open the door of that larder and remove by hand whatever they could afford? Instead of being stocked with products of a uniform shape â€“ products that could be relied on to move forward in the embrace of a spiral then fall in predictable ways â€“ a machine could sell anything. Loose golf balls. Bikinis. A jeroboam of champagne. A curved banana. Over time, the tempting possibility of vending fresh fruit had frustrated the tinkerers like Johnny Brod, because fruit tends to create jams inside traditional machines, figuratively and sometimes literally. Micro-markets full of swipe-to-open larders and fridges began to open in offices, factories and prisons across the US. Sensitive shelves and CCTV cameras helped determine who had bought what. In Europe and the UK, Selecta opened about 150 micro-markets which, at least until the summer of 2021, were in workplaces not accessible to curious outsiders. That week in July 2021, however, Selecta had opened a micro-market for use by anybody in East Croydon train station in London. A small retail unit by the gates had been fitted with larders full of fruit tubs, wide-bottomed milkshakes, shallow nut trays, Jaffa Cakes in sealed blue parcels. Everything was left unattended, at the disposal of any passing customer with a credit card. For most of the morning on 21 July 2021, according to figures later provided to me by Selecta, the East Croydon micro-market went unused. Then, a canned latte, a ham-and-cheese croissant later, sales crept up. By mid-afternoon, as I stood in Johnny Brodâ€™s lab, about 20 items were being removed from the London micro-market every hour. Hummus chips. Bircher muesli pots. Juices laced with ginseng. Johnny Brod was so unnerved by Selectaâ€™s innovative leap, heâ€™d sent a spy south. He checked and rechecked his phone, waiting to receive word from East Croydon. Next to his concept lab there was a large staff lounge, its walls lined with old, experimental Broderickâ€™s machines, and we killed some time in there. A few of the old machines had no touchscreen. One had only touchscreen, its entire front replaced by a doorway-sized digital display. Johnny Brod had been among the first to embrace screens, back in 2011, an innovation that later became the industry norm. But his all-screen, only-screen model never took off; customers, it turned out, needed to see the object of their desire. Now this lone model stood as monument to noble failure in the Wythenshawe lounge. At last his phone buzzed and Johnny Brod read his spyâ€™s report on the new micro-market. â€œItâ€™s quite nice apparently,â€<9d> he said, sounding forlorn. * * * At 5.51pm the snack machine in Blackfriars in London sold a porridge-to-go bar. At 6.04pm, a mango drink. It was one of those newer vending machines that could talk, and it spoke to customers with a robotic, feminine voice, advising, apologising. Another machine, many thousands of miles away, told prospective customers: â€œMy name is James, I serve delicious snacks.â€<9d> James was situated in an apartment block overlooking the Langat River in Malaysia. He had his own Twitter account. Spend any time immersed in the vending world and you start to see that these machines, insentient cumbersome things, are repositories for the most unlikely human notions and emotions. There was once a drinks dispenser in Singapore that had to be cuddled before it would unloose a can. That was a bid to teach us something about spontaneous acts of compassion, courtesy of Coca-Cola Incorporated. We bring our prejudices to these machines. We have ungracious feelings for them that they know nothing about; we anticipate their betrayal. There was once a Seinfeld episode dedicated to George Constanzaâ€™s furious efforts to secure a snagged Twix. When Johnny Brod lent a branded coffee-maker to the producers of the ITV drama Cold Feet, he was pained to see it malfunctioning for dramatic purposes. (â€œAnd our competitors love putting clips of that online.â€<9d>) In one of my earliest London memories I am on an underground platform, watching a disgruntled man in a raincoat apply a handmade out-of-order sign to a Cadburyâ€™s chocolate dispenser. Heâ€™d fed in his coin. But no Dairy Milk. I still remember his appalled expression, his wounded grace as he warned off others. This initial encounter did not prejudice me against the machines. Instead, Iâ€™ve always found them to emanate reassurance, particularly so during moments of dislocation: jetlagged layovers, late-night jobs, early starts. I first noticed their palliative effect at school, when we called it going venders (â€œYou going venders?â€<9d>) and when a visit to the machines meant a respite from classwork, junior lust, the bickering over which bands were best. One day a savvy pupil set himself up in competition with the school venders. He started to sell the same snacks, cheaper, from his backpack. I stayed loyal to the machines. They had inexhaustible patience, they let you ponder every option, walk up, walk away, malinger at the glass, wallow in a pre-purchase. I think what comforted me then, as now, was their height, their stuffedness, their immobility, their always-on-ness, their middle-of-the-night-ness, their there-til-the-end-ness. A decade ago, when my wife went into a long and intermittently frightening labour that lasted for days, my bleary walks to the hospital vending machines took on the character of therapy, necessary little trips out of chaos to find something sturdy, upright, understood. How right it felt that in Cormac McCarthyâ€™s dystopian novel The Road, the last can of Coke in a ruined world had to be plucked from the innards of an old vending machine. So often they are a comfort of final resort, as anybody who has concocted a contingency meal in a budget hotel or a motorway service-station will know. They facilitate jokes, complaints, unhealthy diets, but the emotions these machines inspire are real. I know of at least one love story that has a vending machine as its core. Fiona Chambers of SV24-7 first met her husband, Ian, when she was a salesperson for a drinks firm. Ian was a buyer. â€œIâ€™m not saying that we flirted, exactly,â€<9d> she recalled, â€œbut hey-ho. I sold him a shitload of Cokes.â€<9d> The more time I spent with Johnny Brod, the more I saw how sincerely concerned he was for his fleet. He had a horror of unclean machines, having once inherited a second-hand BevMax that had spores of mould growing in its corners. Heâ€™d been known to clamber down on his belly in malls or on airport concourses, to peer under retrieval wells, dragging out chocolate wrappers, recovering abandoned flip-flops. His machines were like his pets or his zoo animals. He maintained them with fastidious care, and he couldnâ€™t let me leave Manchester, he said, without taking me on safari to visit a prized specimen. Over in Leeds General, said Johnny Brod, he owned an absolute beauty by the benches in A&amp;E, a machine that was much used by fight-night drunks. â€œInsane on weekends â€¦ we canâ€™t fill it fast enough.â€<9d> And he loved his BevMaxes by the luggage belt in the local airport. â€œBecause if that belt breaks down, Iâ€™ve got you trapped.â€<9d> But the machine he wanted to show me was in Manchesterâ€™s Trafford Centre shopping mall. No gimmicks, no tricks, just a boss dispenser in a prime location, capable of slurping in thousands of pounds a month. He drove us over in an SUV. â€œThere,â€<9d> Johnny Brod whispered, signalling for us to halt on a concourse near a spotless, richly stocked BevMax. It loomed, looking tempting. â€œWait,â€<9d> he muttered. It was like watching a well-baited snare. He knew it wouldnâ€™t take long. Soon a young shopper paused on her way through from clothes and jewellery, leaning in to ponder the choice. Water? Fanta Lemon? When she kept walking, I told Johnny Brod: tough luck. â€œWait,â€<9d> he repeated. And here she came, returning for water after all. Fanta, too. * * * In Belfast, that night, when Emmet Oppong looked in on his vending machine before bed, no midget gems had been sold. Crinkle-cut crisps had done better, and as usual every Coke he could fit inside was gone. Oppong clicked his pen and did some sums. As long as he wrote off the personal labour, he was satisfied his SnackMart had now paid for itself. He was newly in profit: a vending entrepreneur. Months later, in autumn 2021, and trading as Em Vending Solutions, Oppong would go on to triple the size of his operation, purchasing a pair of silvery machines covered in cartoony decals of Homer Simpson and the Tasmanian Devil, Â£750 the pair. As I came away from Manchester that night in July, I took with me a final image of Johnny Brod, expansionist-king of UK vending, owner of a thousands-strong fleet â€“ standing in front of an empty slab of wall in the Trafford Centre. He took photographs. He noted nearby plug points. He couldnâ€™t believe, he said, he hadnâ€™t thought to put a vending machine there yet. The last time we spoke, in spring 2022, he was about to take delivery of his 25 Autoristas. He was considering an expansion into London Heathrow, â€œwhere they still have the same shit machines you saw in Love Actually, 20 years ago. And you can print that.â€<9d> But back on that July night, at 8.08pm, a swimmer in Glasgow bought a bottle of energy drink from Fiona Chambersâ€™s machine near a public pool. At 9.53pm, Declan Sewellâ€™s chatty machine in Blackfriars sold a final peppermint Aero. A smoked-salmon sandwich and a Pepsi were bought for somebodyâ€™s dinner from East Croydon. Soon all this UK trade would slow, purchases continuing in the US, resuming again in waking Asia. It was nearly midnight in the UK when I arrived back in London from Manchester. As I had made the dayâ€™s first vend, I thought it would be neat if I made the dayâ€™s last vend, too. I wandered around St Pancras station, trying to find a just-so machine that would suit my appetite, as I provisioned and planogrammed ideal arrangements of confectionary and crisps in my head. After a day with the loquacious Johnny Brod, I was pleased by the knowledge that whatever vending machine I found, it would ask for no conversation. Zero civility. We would commune, if we communed at all, with a poked finger and the warm coins I had in my pocket. Perhaps this is at the heart of the machinesâ€™ unique appeal, a displaced misanthropy. Perhaps we transform our gratitude at not having to deal with one more human being today into tenderness for the SnackMarts and Shoppertrons and BevMaxes that feed us and reward us by a path of least resistance. Under a St Pancras escalator, a couple were dancing in front of an automated jukebox. On a concrete walkway beyond, a machine waited to vend foldable Brompton bikes. I checked the Google alerts on my phone, scrolling through social media, too, learning that a radio producer in Chicago had at that moment bought an attractive sugar-dusted ganache from a machine in a garage off Interstate 55. A cannabis-oil manufacturer had put a dispenser on top of a majestic sandstone mountain in Utah, to deliver balms to achey hikers. An animal sanctuary in Colorado was awarded a patent on a vending machine to be used exclusively by captive apes. â€œCome find me near the swimming pool,â€<9d> tweeted James, the Malaysian vending machine, from his fourth-storey berth. In Japan, it was morning. The accountant Masaharu Mizota woke earlier than usual and climbed aboard his motorbike. He drove south, between mountains, crossing bridges, paying at tolls, following a map that was mounted on his handlebars. He pulled into sleepy Uchiko at about 7.30am and parked by the one-of-a-kind vending machine heâ€™d read about. Of all the things to be sold from an ungainly glass-and-steel machine, it was selling pieces of fragile and beautiful origami. There were folded-paper sea creatures. Delicate flowers and birds and stars. After his long journey, Mizota fed in a 50-yen piece, about 30p, and ran a gloved finger over the buttons, trying to choose. â€¢ Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Now a group of Britainâ€™s biggest business names have come together to urge their boardroom peers to abandon dull corporate-speak in the national interest. Senior figures including Juergen Maier, the former chief executive of Siemens UK, and Sir Charlie Mayfield, the former chairman of John Lewis, have launched an organisation to encourage business leaders to speak out about the UKâ€™s biggest economic challenges. Aimed at mentoring the next generation of business leaders so that their voices are heard, the group has developed an app-based platform called vocL to bring together executives who believe companies should engage more in society. Maier, known for outspoken Brexit interventions on the BBCâ€™s Question Time, said business leaders had to stop being scared of speaking in public and recognise that failure to talk openly about politics and economics harms public debate and leaves the field open to their critics. â€œItâ€™s the fear of making a mistake, and saying something that is very brand impactful. Weâ€™ve seen them before: Ratner was probably one of the worst case studies. So you go in with that fear,â€<9d> he said. â€œBut I cannot see a way in which we can solve the challenges weâ€™ve got without a much, much stronger relationship between business and society and public sector. And I think business has to take responsibility and leadership for some of those issues.â€<9d> The jeweller Gerald Ratner has gone down in British business folklore for describing one of his companyâ€™s products as â€œcrapâ€<9d> in a speech in 1991, turning him into a textbook example of why company chiefs should choose their words carefully. Maier said the British economy faced challenges in the recovery from Covid-19 and in tackling global heating that meant firms needed to speak more openly with their customers and the public. vocL is aimed at connecting the most senior figures in British business with aspiring company leaders. Planned to have 150 mentees enrolled this year, the group of City grandees also includes Sir Michael Rake, the former chairman of BT, Paul Drechsler, the former president of the CBI, and James Timpson, the chief executive of the Timpson shoe repair chain. Mayfield said: â€œBusinesses play a key role in society. I hope the dialogues we stimulate will contribute to that by encouraging freer and more diverse exchanges.â€<9d> â€¢ This article was amended on 25 January 2022 to specify that Gerald Ratnerâ€™s comment applied to one item rather than all of his companyâ€™s products.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

The claimants, including representatives of Krenak indigenous communities, are fighting to get compensation for the devastation caused by the Mariana dam disaster in November 2015. The Â£5bn lawsuit is against the Anglo-Australian mining company BHP. When the FundÃ£o tailings dam burst, it released 40m cubic metres of toxic mining waste, killing 19 people and affecting the lives of hundreds of thousands more. The brown, polluted sludge spilled down the River Doce in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, flowing for 400 miles (670km) into the Atlantic Ocean. Thousands were made homeless and livelihoods centred on the river were destroyed. This weekâ€™s court case is the culmination of a three-and-a-half year legal fight in the UK, with lawyers from the London-based international law firm PGMBM representing hundreds of thousands of individuals as well as 530 businesses, 150 members of indigenous communities, 25 municipalities and six religious organisations. PGMBM filed the lawsuit in 2018, and last July won the right to reopen the case after an earlier ruling denied jurisdiction for English courts to hear it. A representative of the Krenak indigenous communities in London said yesterday: â€œEvery time that I remember what my family and my community has gone through, every time that I revisit the river, I become angry. â€œThese times are a time of great struggle for my people, and I have made it my purpose to help us achieve fair compensation. Alas, I understand that no matter how hard we fight, much of what the companies have taken from our people is irrecoverable. For it to have been suggested by the defendants that my community is receiving full redress in Brazil makes me even angrier.â€<9d> Tom Goodhead, managing partner of PGMBM, said: â€œBHP is a multinational that generates huge profits in the regions where it operates, and it is only right that the company â€¦ is held directly accountable at its headquarters. The days of huge corporations doing what they want in countries on the other side of the world and getting away with it are over. In Brazil, BHP, along with the Brazilian iron-ore mining company Vale, and Samarco, the joint venture company responsible for managing the FundÃ£o tailings dam, established the Renova Foundation to mitigate the environmental consequences of the collapse and to provide compensation for individuals and some small businesses for loss and damages. By November 2021, Renova had spent more than 19.6bn Brazilian reals (Â£2.6bn) on environmental and economic reparations and rehabilitation projects, including R$7.78bn in compensation and financial aid to 359,000 people, according to the company. BHP had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. The hearing is due to continue until Friday and will be heard by three senior court of appeal judges. It is being streamed on Londonâ€™s court of appeal YouTube channel.

Hereâ€™s your postmortem on the feature-length finale, Lock &amp; Key â€¦ Pollyâ€™s prophesy came to pass â€œOne of you will die. Which I cannot tell.â€<9d> This barrelling episode began with vengeful Michael Gray (Finn Cole) finally getting out of jail, where heâ€™d been simmering all series after being set up by Tommy (Cillian Murphy). His intentions to kill his cousin had been stated all series. Now moustachioed Mikey (donâ€™t call him that) put his plan into action. Tommy flew (how new-fangled) to the smugglersâ€™ haven of Miquelon Island to collect the $5m payment for his opium shipment. Michael placed a briefcase bomb in his car. Well, his mother, Polly, (flashbacks of the mighty Helen McCrory) foresaw that Tommy wouldnâ€™t be killed by a bullet. When Michael made his excuses to leave the motor, there was a window-shattering kaboom. Except it was the car behind, full of Boston mobsters, which blew to smithereens. Cue cheers from sofas as good ole Johnny Dogs (Packy Lee) popped up to tell Tommy: â€œI switched the ticker like you said, Tom.â€<9d> Always one step ahead. Getting a bullet through the eye for his trouble, Michael went to meet his maker and his mother. Longsuffering Lizzie left â€œYou are cursed, Tommy,â€<9d> wept his wife Lizzie (Natasha Oâ€™Keeffe). With their daughter Ruby dead, thereâ€™s an argument to say that Tommy didnâ€™t need her any more. Young Charles, remember, is the son of Tommyâ€™s late first wife Grace. Heâ€™d grown increasingly distant, not even telling her about his terminal tumour. The final straw was sleeping with the enemy, Diana Mitford (Amber Anderson). Yet it was heartbreaking when Lizzie removed her rings, packed her bags and walked out. Charles (Billy Jenkins) opted to go with her, pointing out â€œyouâ€™re more my mum than he is my dadâ€<9d>. Oof. â€œLook after your mother and tell her Iâ€™m sorry,â€<9d> said Tommy. You deserve better, Lizzie. Always outnumbered, never outgunned After a series on the periphery and on heroin, big brother Arthur (Paul Anderson) got clean, aided by the return of his wife Linda (Kate Phillips). After a touching scene of brokenhearted brotherly love with Tommy, he had work to do. The South Boston mob dispatched the IRA to assassinate him at the Garrison. But they were expected. Charlie Strong (Ned Dennehy) acted as a decoy, luring Laura â€œCaptain Swingâ€<9d> McKee (Charlene McKenna) and her soldiers into a trap. In a slowburn shootout reminiscent of Battleship Potemkinâ€™s Odessa Steps sequence, complete with crying baby, the IRA trio played cat-and-mouse with Arthur, Charlie and Jeremiah Jesus (Benjamin Zephaniah). The coup de grÃ¢ce was â€œan old keepsake from Passchendaeleâ€<9d>. The Peakys released mustard gas into the mist-shrouded alley and emerged in gas masks to gun down their opponents. Arthur gave McKee a gulp of filtered air to ensure she was conscious when he extracted payback for Aunt Polly. â€œVengeance is for the Lord,â€<9d> she gasped, to which he replied: â€œNot in Small Heath it ainâ€™t. Rest in peace, Poll.â€<9d> Welcome back, Arthur. Weâ€™ve missed you. Itâ€™s always the quiet ones â€œCan you keep a secret?â€<9d> Charlie asked Tommyâ€™s illegitimate son, Erasmus â€œDukeâ€<9d> Shelby (Conrad Khan). The fact that he was showing the young buck around the gangâ€™s well-stocked armoury gave a clue what was to come. Too many bad memories and a desire to burn down his ill-gotten gains meant Tommy wanted his country pile Arrow House emptied, razed to the ground and replaced by social housing. He dispatched a crew led by Isiah Jesus (Daryl McCormack) to drink the wine cellar dry, dig up the bodies buried in the grounds and send them to â€œMr Patches to put in the furnaceâ€<9d> (this unseen figure is surely a spin-off show waiting to happen). By candlelight, the â€œgardenersâ€<9d> arrived. Except Tommy had deduced that Billy Grade (Emmett J Scanlan) was the â€œblack catâ€<9d> traitor and that youngest brother Finn (Harry Kirton) was equally untrustworthy. No wonder heâ€™d been sidelined. Duke executed Billy and banished Finn from the family. A feud for the future. We last saw Duke, now with proper Peaky haircut, having instructions whispered in his ear by Tommy. Cult heroes came to the fore Like a frontman introducing the band, writer Steven Knight ensured this legacy tour gave much-loved characters their moment in the spotlight. Not only did â€œUncleâ€<9d> Charlie come good. So did Johnny Dogs and Isiah. Fan favourite Alfie Solomons (Tom Hardy) arrived for one last spot of scenery-chewing, announcing himself with â€œI smell the smell of roasting Irishmenâ€<9d>. It turned out to be the mumbling Jewish mobster who was the only hotel guest on Miquelon Island. In return for Tommy selling his opium to the Solomons gang and giving them Boston supremacy, Alfie signed over Camden Town to Tommy. Dear, dependable Curly (Ian Peck) proved his worth once more and got a Tommy cuddle of gratitude. Arthur raised a toast to late brother John (Joe Cole). Even housekeeper Frances (Pauline Turner) got a seat at the table. The gangâ€™s all here. Right dishonourable members Thomas Shelby MPâ€™s final appearance in the Commons wasnâ€™t what youâ€™d call conventional. He met Mitford on the famous green leatherette seats, requesting support for his housing bill â€“ while outlining his leverage on an artfully folded paper plane. Mitford â€œwanted to fuck here, on these benchesâ€<9d> but staunch socialist Tommy refused to go over to the Tory side, insisting she cross the floor. Order, order. Mitfordâ€™s fiancÃ© Oswald Mosley (Sam Claflin) interrupted in the nick of time, handing Tommy an invitation to the coupleâ€™s wedding in Berlin â€“ at which the FÃ¼hrer himself would be in attendance. Luckily Tommy had business in Newfoundland. Good riddance, gruesome twosome. Mistrust me, Iâ€™m a doctor Like Nick Cave sings: â€œHeâ€™s a god, heâ€™s a man, heâ€™s a ghost.â€<9d> In many ways, as Tommy admitted to Arthur, they never came back from the Great War. The siblings have been dead men walking for 15 years. Was Tommyâ€™s brain tumour going to succeed where his human foes failed? Of course not. Thereâ€™s a feature film to make first. So how was our antihero going to cheat death this time? Tommy took himself off to die in a Gypsy wagon, held a revolver to his head (again) â€“ and had a magical vision of deceased daughter Ruby (Orla McDonagh) telling him: â€œYouâ€™re not even sick. Youâ€™ve must live, daddy.â€<9d> Relighting his campfire, Tommy spotted a picture of Mosleyâ€™s wedding in a charred newspaper â€“ and a familiar face among the guests: physician Dr Holford (Aneurin Barnard), alongside the female colleague heâ€™d recommended for a second opinion. Tommy didnâ€™t have inoperable tuberculoma after all. The deadly diagnosis was a fascist ruse. Contrived, certainly. Neither did it explain the seizures. But spine-tingling all the same. As the clock struck 11 for Armistice hour, Tommy spared Holfordâ€™s life. â€œPeace at last,â€<9d> he murmured. His caravan was set ablaze by Holfordâ€™s manservant. Heâ€™d be assumed dead and could make a fresh start. He rode off into the sunset a free man â€“ â€œback where we began: horses and caravans, vagabonds and thievesâ€<9d>. See you on the silver screen, Tom. Good things come to those who wait Many commenters have expressed frustration with the meandering pace of this swansong series. Iâ€™ve cut it some slack for having to work around both the pandemic and the tragic loss of McCrory, keeping faith that all would come to fruition. For me, it definitely did. This was a thrumming, electrifying way to sign off. Sure, it didnâ€™t tick every box. Several major characters were under-utilised this series, notably Arthur, Alfie and Ada, her stand-in stint as boss aside. At least Tommy handed her the reins. There was no sign of Winston Churchill or Liverpool Docks union convener Hayden Stagg, meaning Stephen Grahamâ€™s role was limited to just two scenes. Neither was there any comeuppance for fascist Boston boss Jack Nelson (James Frecheville) â€“ although we can assume the Jewish mob will put paid to him. Yet any fears that Peaky Blinders might â€œdo a Game of Thronesâ€<9d> were put to bed by a satisfyingly propulsive parting shot. Clocking in at 81 minutes, weâ€™d been promised a mini-movie, a dry run for the forthcoming feature, and thatâ€™s what we got. This was part western, part gangster epic and so tense, I barely drew breath for the first hour. Hard to believe itâ€™s nine years since Tommy first clip-clopped down Watery Lane. He ended where he began, alone on horseback. Tommy had â€œbeen on a journey from the backstreets to the corridors of powerâ€<9d>. Now we Peaky Blinders rest. Me? Iâ€™m off to look at the fog. Line of the week Spoilt for choice in an episode replete with one-liners, many of them from Alfie. But in the face of stiff competition, we enjoyed that mother warning her daughter: â€œIf you get lost in the fog, the Peaky Blinders will get you.â€<9d> The ultimate Brum bogeymen. Anachronistic soundtrack-spotting We opened with Mozartâ€™s Lacrimosa and left on Lisa Oâ€™Neillâ€™s cover of Bob Dylanâ€™s All The Tired Horses. In between, the musical highlight was the debut play of Radiohead side project The Smileâ€™s new single Pana-vision, soundtracking Tommyâ€™s near-suicide. Itâ€™s just a slight surprise we didnâ€™t bow out with a blast of Red Right Hand. Thereâ€™s a gathering storm alright â€¦ Notes and observations Tommy started series one on a black steed. He ended series six on a white one. Symbolic. â€œThe BSA factory on Armoury Roadâ€<9d> is indeed a Small Heath landmark. Sleaford Mods frontman Jason Williamson was perfect as ranting preacher Lazarus. Bravo to director Anthony Byrne who heroically helmed the showâ€™s last 12 episodes under testing circumstances. He ended on a humdinger, full of operatic crescendoes and handsome cinematography. Letâ€™s raise one last whiskey to Sarah Hughes, much-loved previous custodian of this blog. Her posthumous memoir, Holding Tight, Letting Go, was published last week. Wonder what Lady Sarah would have made of this finale? Thanks for your wise and witty company this series, soldiers.

But Falklands War: The Untold Story (Channel 4) marks 40 years since the conflict between Britain and Argentina, and this thorough, rigorous documentary is an exhaustive and engaging account of what happened, by many who were there. It is done with fittingly military precision, and takes the approach of a day-by-day countdown, talking viewers through key events via maps, charts and diagrams. This is useful as the action is explained at a pace that leaves little time for people less familiar with the history of it to catch up. It assumes a level of knowledge about the conflict already, and although there is the odd explanatory note, I imagine those with a solid understanding of military terms may feel more at ease with it. However, the story that this documentary aims to tell is not necessarily one that has been told before, and that allows for a gripping narrative to unravel. This was a British victory, but the film does not gloss over the cost of that, nor does it back away from the seemingly numerous occasions when that win was far from certain. Several contributors are speaking publicly about their roles for the first time, most notably Lt Col Michael Rose, the head of the SAS in the Falklands, whose steady tone belies a frankness about the operation and speaks candidly of its flaws. Rose calls the conflict â€œa command and control muddle from the startâ€<9d> and paints a picture of a fractured chain of command, ill-suited to the distance, conditions and demands of the South Atlantic terrain. The only orders he was given, he claims, were: â€œPlease do the best you can.â€<9d> Other senior figures describe the pitfalls of the British plan or, more crucially, the lack of a cohesive one. One key brigadier is indecisive by reputation, and the decisions he did make continue to baffle other senior commanders. There are many â€œshould haveâ€<9d> and â€œcould haveâ€<9d> and â€œmaybe ifâ€<9d> moments, and at least two scenarios which, had they played out even slightly differently, might have ended in victory for Argentina. One officer describes an evacuation in appalling weather, the loss of two helicopters, and the notion that had men been killed at this very early stage, on day 20 â€“ as they very nearly were â€“ the war might not have progressed. There are stories in which 10 minutes made all the difference to the outcome. The arrival of the British supply ship, the Atlantic Conveyor, on Argentinaâ€™s independence day, which was attacked in daylight by Argentinian forces resulting in the deaths of 12 sailors, is called â€œthe biggest logistical disaster of the warâ€<9d>. The tiny, crucial twists and turns when it comes to planning and chance are fascinating. For all of the strategic detail, though, there are welcome touches of cultural analysis. The then foreign correspondent Max Hastings, who reported from the Falklands, paints a picture of Britain in the late 1970s and early 80s as fiercely divided, the manufacturing industry in the doldrums, riots in the cities. He recalls flag-waving and jingoism as the ships sailed from Southampton, people united behind the idea that the servicemen and women were â€œoff to fight Johnny foreignerâ€<9d>. Some of the military figures compare it to their time in Northern Ireland, pointing out that to the public, by contrast, this looked like â€œa real war, against an enemy in uniformâ€<9d>. The candour and scope is impressive and decisions are examined from all sides. This is a British film, so naturally leans towards British personnel, but there are interviews with Argentinian combatants too, and accounts of what they were fighting for, and why. There are participants from across the ranks, with two particular standout moments. The first is when Rose listens, for the first time, to a recording of negotiations with Argentina, transmitted via satellite back to the UK, and hears his voice from 40 years ago. As his old self transmits one last crackling â€œoverâ€<9d>, the present-day Rose holds a finger up and says, â€œEnd of the war.â€<9d> It is powerful. The other is the focus on trauma, which dominates the final few minutes, as a medic and a private recall the fighting, and speak eloquently about the post-traumatic stress disorder they were left with. But when they talk about mistakes, one says, it is not to apportion blame. It is to learn lessons for the future, so they do not happen in the same way again.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

He poisoned the trio with thallium then tried to cover his tracks, did not deploy his medical knowledge to help his partner and lied about what happened, the judge found. The ruling has been handed down by Mr Justice Williams in the family court at the end of a case between the doctor and his now former partner over the arrangements for the care of their child. The case is highly unusual legally because the medic has been found to have committed the killing in a civil court, on the balance of probabilities of the evidence, rather than in a criminal court, in which a jury has to be sure beyond all reasonable doubt. â€œIt is truly horrifying that any doctor who has signed the Hippocratic oath would be responsible for killing someone else and attempting to kill other people,â€<9d> said Simon Bruce, a senior family law specialist solicitor who was part of the womanâ€™s legal team.â€<9d> While most cases that come before the family court involve injuries, harassment and domestic abuse, Bruce added, â€œthe killing of the childâ€™s grandfather, and the attempted killing of the mother and grandmother, are off the scale of unusualnessâ€<9d>. The Guardian is unable to disclose the doctorâ€™s name because in the judgment the judge ordered that his identity, the mother of his child and their son had to remain anonymous. However, Williams said in his judgment that the poisoner was a Bulgarian-born doctor who had moved to the UK in the late 2000s. The medic had a relationship with the woman, a bookkeeper and fellow Bulgarian who had been granted British citizenship, and their child was born in 2010. The court found that he added thallium to a pot of coffee when he, his then partner, their then one-year-old child and her parents were on holiday in Bulgaria in September 2012. His partner and her parents drank from the pot while the doctor had instant coffee instead. The childâ€™s grandfather died two days later. The two women became seriously ill but survived. The doctor and his partner separated soon afterwards. The Bulgarian police have made inquiries into the poisoning and interviewed the medic, and the Metropolitan police have also been notified. But he has not been charged with any criminal offence. â€œThe circumstances around my fatherâ€™s death and the thought of how he had suffered from the effects of the poison in his last hours will haunt me forever. No one could possible imagine the excruciating pain my mother and I felt as a result of the poisoning in the first six weeks after we had been poisoned,â€<9d> the woman told the Guardian. â€œEvery day I suffer tremendously bearing the thought that I brought a murderer to my parentsâ€™ house and that my dad died as a direct result of this. What I have been through is a nightmare.â€<9d> The doctor began legal action in 2018 in an attempt to gain access to his son after he and his partner separated. She argued that he should not have contact because he had poisoned her parents and herself. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US say that thallium, a heavy metal, â€œis tasteless and odourless and has been used by murderers as a difficult to detect poisonâ€<9d>. After a five-day hearing last year, Williams ruled in favour of the mother. He found that on the balance of probabilities her claim that he had poisoned her and her parents was correct. During the hearing the doctorâ€™s former partner told how he insisted they leave Bulgaria for Britain when the debilitating effects of the poisoning were starting to appear. She said that once back in the UK, he did little to help her get medical help, despite her hair falling out and her suffering sudden weight loss. It was later determined that the woman, her mother and her father had all been poisoned. In what the judge said was a ruse to evade detection for what he had done, the doctor told fellow medics seeking to identify the source of her sickness that she may be suffering from Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, a rare and serious nerve condition. In his judgment Williams several times noted that the doctor had told lies in the different accounts he had given of events surrounding the poisoning. His evidence during the hearing was â€œrather fracturedâ€<9d> and at time â€œfelt like a constructâ€<9d> and he was â€œinsincereâ€<9d> when answering questions, the judge noted. â€œOverall, I found him to be a quite unsatisfactory witness,â€<9d> he added. He also noted: â€œThe father as a qualified medical doctor would have had the intellectual capacity to determine the amounts of thallium that would be required to deliver a sufficient dose to kill an individual without delivering such a significant dose as to make it obvious to the consumer of the drink that it had been contaminated.â€<9d> â€œAt a time when the mother was frantic and had come to believe that she was poisoned, his failure to do anything of substance on the medical front is almost inexplicable save by prior knowledge of the causes,â€<9d> he added. The doctor is not currently working. The Guardian sought his response to the court judgment. A statement issued by Delphine Philip Law, his solicitors, said: â€œHe vehemently denies the motherâ€™s allegations that he poisoned her or her parents. He stated that the court took inadequate account of the fact that there was no direct evidence to corroborate [his former partnerâ€™s] allegations.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

In a submission to Treasury, the Consumer Action Law Centre (Calc) said the draft terms of reference of the review should be scrapped and re-written to explicitly include insurance commissions, which Kenneth Hayne â€“ the retired judge who headed the royal commission â€“ said were difficult to justify. The royal commission heard evidence that commissions were harming consumers. Pastor Grant Stewart gave evidence in 2018 that his son, who has Downâ€™s syndrome and difficulty understanding whether things were cheap or expensive, bought funeral, accidental death and accidental injury insurance sold to him over the phone by a company called Freedom Insurance, which then refused to cancel the policies. The commission heard Freedomâ€™s sales agents were incentivised through commissions and prizes including a â€œboat partyâ€<9d> and a trip to Bali â€“ which the company admitted encouraged aggressive and inappropriate sales. The company no longer sells insurance. Junk insurance has also been targeted by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, which in 2020 said it had secured $160m in remediation for consumers who bought useless products. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In Thursdayâ€™s submission, Calc said that although the Treasury reviewâ€™s draft terms of reference claimed to be consistent with Hayneâ€™s recommendations, it could not â€œbe said to be meaningfully implementing these recommendations without considering commissioner Hayneâ€™s commentary on the conflicts between interest and duty in financial servicesâ€<9d>. â€œThese findings, and the evidence at the royal commission of atrocious sales behaviour motivated by commissions and incentives, appear to have been forgotten in the drafting of the TOR, which make no reference to these issues.â€<9d> Cat Newton, a senior policy officer at Calc, said it seemed like the government had largely forgotten the harm uncovered by the royal commission. â€œItâ€™s good that the review is happening â€“ it was slated to happen around 2022 â€“ but what we really need is for this review to be meaningfully examining these issues, and making sure itâ€™s proposing solutions that are going to prevent the harm that we saw at the royal commission, otherwise itâ€™s not doing justice to those issues,â€<9d> she said. Conflicted remuneration â€“ commissions and other incentives â€“ in selling financial advice were abolished after the royal commission but Newton said they remained at large in the insurance business. â€œWe know it motivates appalling sales behaviour, where the emphasis is on making the sale rather than getting people into the product that they want or need and understand,â€<9d> she said. â€œSo we think all conflicted remuneration needs to go and that would be really beneficial to people, it would mean that theyâ€™re getting into products that they want and that they need and that are useful for them, rather than just being flogged a product based on somebody wanting a trip to Bali or a boat tour.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

I have to look to other means: a fallen feather, footprints in mud, hairs caught in fence wire. A dramatic sight, though, is a dismembered pigeon in the field near our house. Plucked feathers lie scattered in a wide circle like spume on a beach. The head has gone and the flesh has been ripped from the breastbone, leaving only wings and feet splayed on the ground. A drama unwitnessed, itâ€™s a sign that a sparrowhawk has fed. Only a female sparrowhawk would have taken a bird the size of a pigeon. The male, being smaller, preys on tits, finches or sparrows, not catching anything larger than a mistle thrush. The svelte sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus, with its short rounded wings and long tail, is built for quick sprints in woodland, where it can manoeuvre at speed through the trees. Able to turn on a sixpence, it is thrilling to watch as it hurtles through close-set trunks with complete focus. I had heard sparrowhawks calling in late summer as the young learned their way around a nearby wood. A messy nest of sticks will have been built in the dense cover of the lower tree canopy, the female staying tight while the male did all the hunting to feed both her and the chicks. Males are blue-grey above with rufous underparts; females have beautifully barred chests with grey-brown rippling lines rather like a cuckoo. In fact, it is thought that cuckoos evolved plumage to mimic hawks in order to scare their hosts and get easier access to their nests. Returning home at teatime, I round the corner of the house and startle â€“ and am startled by â€“ a sparrowhawk, zooming towards me just two feet from the ground. In that flash of a moment we make eye contact, before the bird veers off in a smooth arc and slips through the narrow gap between the log store and a wall. I stand there, feeling the quivering of air that is all the sparrowhawk has left behind. â€¢ Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

It knocked out a number of his teeth including his front teeth,â€<9d> the soldier told the court. â€œI was in shock.â€<9d> In emotional and dramatic evidence, the former SAS soldier, who was on the patrol led by Roberts-Smith, testified to the alleged killing of the unarmed man in the village of Darwan in 2012. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times over reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying and domestic violence. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing, including the alleged unlawful killing in Darwan. The former soldier was anonymised before court as Person 4. He was a witness called by the newspapers under force of subpoena. The court heard on 11 September 2012, Roberts-Smithâ€™s patrol was involved in an operation in Darwan, in Uruzgan province, seeking a rogue Afghan soldier called Hekmatullah, who had killed three Australian troops. Hekmatullah was not found in the village. Person 4 told the court towards the end of the mission, the Australian troops encountered a man in a compound. He said the man was not armed and had a donkey loaded with firewood. Witnesses in Afghanistan, who gave evidence in the newspapersâ€™ defence last year, named the man as Ali Jan. They told the court he was a farmer visiting Darwan from a neighbouring village. Person 4 said the man was taken into custody, his hands cuffed behind his back, and placed inside the compound facing a wall. He said Roberts-Smith took charge of questioning the detained man. Shortly after, according to Person 4 the Australian troops received communications to move to their extraction point, to be removed from the village by helicopter. Person 4, as he moved to the corner of another compound, looked back towards where the man had been detained. He told the court he saw the detained man, still handcuffed, now outside the compound standing above a â€œlong, steep slopeâ€<9d>, being held there by another soldier, known before court as Person 11. â€œAt the same time I noticed Ben Roberts-Smith. He had walked to a position maybe three or four metres away. As I was trying to understand [what was happening] he turned around and walked forward and kicked the individual in the chest. â€œ[Person 11] was still holding the individual â€“ the individual was catapulted backwards and fell down the slope.â€<9d> Person 4 said he watched the man fall and hit a large rock. He gave evidence that he followed Roberts-Smith and Person 11 down a track system that led to a dry creek bed, where the man had landed. â€œI was in shock â€¦ it was something I had never encountered before â€¦ seeing that individual go over the side.â€<9d> The man was still alive when the soldiers reached the creek bed, Person 4 told the court. â€œThe individual was quite dusty and had sustained a serious facial injury. As we were approaching that individual, he attempted to sit up and then fell back down again.â€<9d> Person 4 told the court Roberts-Smith ordered him and Person 11 to drag the man across the creek bed under a tree, an order Person 4 told the court he followed. The detained Afghan man was standing up, when Person 4 said he began to walk away towards the helicopter landing zone. He said he was four or five metres away, and heard Roberts-Smith and Person 11 speaking, but could not discern what they were saying. He heard â€œtwo or three roundsâ€<9d> fired from a suppressed M4 rifle and turned to see Person 11 with his weapon lifted to his shoulder â€œstill in a position to shootâ€<9d>. The detained Afghan had been shot. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Person 4 said Roberts-Smith then told Person 4 to give him the camera he was carrying, allegedly saying â€œwe need to take some photosâ€<9d>. Person 4 was shown photographs in court of a manâ€™s body with an â€œICOMâ€<9d> â€“ a radio used by insurgents to communicate â€“ next to it. Person 4 identified it as the man he had seen kicked off the cliff. Person 4 testified the slain man was not carrying a radio â€œto my knowledgeâ€<9d>. He told the court he believed the radio, because it was wet, had come from the body of another man, earlier killed in battle by Roberts-Smith, after Roberts-Smith had swum solo across a river to engage him. Person 4 told the court that back at the Australiansâ€™ barracks Roberts-Smith had spoken to the patrol and said: â€œthis is what the story isâ€<9d>. Person 4 testified Roberts-Smith said: â€œthe story is we engaged a spotter whilst moving to our HLZ [helicopter landing zone].â€<9d> Roberts-Smith has consistently denied he unlawfully killed anybody on operation at any time, and specifically during the mission in Darwan. In his evidence he told the court that he and a comrade had encountered the man purported to be Ali Jan as they were climbing an embankment to be â€œextractedâ€<9d> from Darwan by helicopter. The man had been carrying a radio, refused an order to stop and was lawfully â€œengagedâ€<9d>, Roberts-Smith said. He claims he was a legitimate target shot dead in a firefight, in accordance with the laws of war. Roberts-Smith maintained he could not have killed the man as alleged because there was no cliff from which to kick him. â€œThere was no cliff â€¦ there was no kick,â€<9d> he told the court. The testimony from Person 4 follows evidence about Darwan heard by the court from Afghan witnesses who testified in the trial last year. Ali Janâ€™s nephew Mohammed Hanifa Fatih told the court last year he had seen a big soldier with a wet, sandy uniform kick Ali Jan in the chest, causing the handcuffed man to fall down the steep embankment into a dry creek bed. â€œHe was rolling down, rolling down until he reached the river,â€<9d> Hanifa told the court. Hanifa said he had lost sight of Ali Jan as he rolled down the embankment but had later heard gunshots being fired, and had seen Ali Janâ€™s body being dragged by two soldiers â€œto the berry treesâ€<9d> nearby. Under cross-examination, Hanifa was accused of confecting evidence out of hatred towards the Australian troops. â€œWhat I said is true,â€<9d> Hanifa replied. â€œI saw these things.â€<9d> On Monday afternoon, the court heard extensive argument about whether Person 4 should be compelled to answer questions about other aspects of his military service in Afghanistan. Another witness in the trial has previously claimed they saw person 4 standing over a dead Afghan prisoner immediately after hearing shots fired during a different operation. Person 4 on Monday refused to answer questions from lawyers for the newspapers about the events during a raid on a compound called Whiskey 108, in the village of Kakarak, Uruzgan, in 2009. Earlier in this trial, another SAS soldier, Person 41, gave evidence that two Afghan men, one elderly, were discovered hiding from Australian troops in a secret tunnel in a courtyard inside the Whiskey 108 compound. Person 41 said when the two men were found, Person 4 and Ben Roberts-Smith borrowed the suppressor from his weapon. Person 41 told the court he saw Roberts-Smith grab the elderly man â€œby the scruff of his shirtâ€<9d>, walk him until he was in front of Person 4, and force him to his knees. â€œRS [Roberts-Smith] pointed to the Afghan and said to Person 4 â€˜shoot himâ€™,â€<9d> Person 41 told the court. Person 41 said he stepped into a room off the compound to avoid seeing what he believed was about to occur. He said he heard a muffled round fired from an M4 rifle, and waited another â€œ15 or so secondsâ€<9d> before stepping back into the courtyard. He said Roberts-Smith was no longer in the courtyard, but Person 4 was standing above the Afghan male, who was dead from a single bullet wound to the head. Roberts-Smith has previously told the court the allegation he had ordered the man shot was â€œcompletely falseâ€<9d>. Under cross-examination, Person 41 was questioned why he hadnâ€™t reported what heâ€™d seen to his commanders. â€œI just wanted to keep quiet about the whole thing,â€<9d> he told the court. â€œI was a new trooper, on my very first trip with the SAS, I just wanted to toe the line. Itâ€™s the unwritten rule â€“ you go along with whatever happens.â€<9d> On Monday afternoon, lawyers representing Person 4, representing the newspapers, and representing Roberts-Smith, debated whether Person 4 should be compelled to testify on the events of Whiskey 108, even under a certificate protecting him from self-incrimination. Person 4â€™s lawyer, Ben Kremer, told the court that even with the protection of the judge-issued certificate, he could be at risk of prosecution internationally if he wasnâ€™t prosecuted in Australia. â€œThere is no protection from the certificateâ€¦ this court should exercise its discretion not to compel the witness to answer questions.â€<9d> Nicholas Owens SC, for the newspapers, told the court he would not press Person 4 to answer questions about Whiskey 108. He conceded the risk of an International Criminal Court prosecution â€œcould not be excludedâ€<9d>. â€œThere is some risk of prosecution in the ICC.â€<9d> Arthur Moses SC, acting for Roberts-Smith, said the newspapers and Person 4 had struck agreement that he would not be pressed to answer questions on Whiskey 108, describing the undisclosed arrangement as a â€œpantomimeâ€<9d> before the court, one that impacted upon the reliability and credibility of Person 4â€™s other evidence.

An investigation","https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/30/symmetry-filters-tiktok-symmetrical-faces-beauty","https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/30/symmetry-filters-tiktok-symmetrical-faces-beauty","People on TikTok are obsessed with facial symmetry, which means, per the laws of the algorithm, I am too. I started playing with symmetry filters in 2020. The first one I tried, Inverted, doesnâ€™t tweak your features like other filters, it simply reverses the image of your face. It quickly became popular as a quasi-litmus test for beauty: if your face looked the same both ways, the thinking went, you were beautiful. Only a rare few passed, and everyone else was melting down. I watched video after video of people flipping their faces back and forth, panic emerging at the inconsistencies. When I tried myself, the results were unsettling. Every time the camera flipped, my nose seemed to dance in the opposite direction, my jawline moving up and down in time. I first heard the idea that symmetrical faces were more beautiful than non-symmetrical faces when I was very young, and I believed it without question. But this was the late 90s, and I was too busy trying to grow boobs by chugging milk to be neurotic about my face. Plus, I didnâ€™t have the proper tools to investigate my features back then. It wasnâ€™t until college that I became convinced I had a â€œgoodâ€<9d> side and a â€œbadâ€<9d> side â€“ and it isnâ€™t a coincidence that this happened when Facebook became ubiquitous. This was the era of the party album. Every time my friends and I went out, we dedicated at least 15 minutes to lining up for each otherâ€™s digital cameras. As soon as I realized that I preferred the photos when I was standing on the right side of the line, I studied my face in the mirror to try to understand why. I could never find the reason, which irritated me, since the evidence was right there in my Facebook tags. Never mind that my friends claimed they had bad sides, too, but looking at the photos, I could never see their differences either. As with all insecurities, mine were true and theirs were not. Ten years later, I got the opportunity to try out a True Mirror for a story. The True Mirror is a mirrored contraption housed in a black box that, through some trickery, presents your face to you in reverse â€“ the way people see you in real life. According to the marketing, looking into a True Mirror is like meeting yourself for the first time; the tagline is, unsubtly: â€œSee how you really are!â€<9d> More accurately, see how lopsided you really are. When it arrived, everyone at the office looked into it with horror. Eyebrows cocked, cheeks drooped, lips involuntarily smirked. Nobody could bear to look (or look away). We believed that what we were seeing was finally â€œthe truthâ€<9d> about our faces, and yet everyone was convinced they looked crooked and absurd, a collection of Picasso-like features that no one else could corroborate. So was it the truth, really? The True Mirror and TikTok symmetry filters both promise a new level of self-awareness and instead deliver anxiety. The Inverted filter faded from popularity last year, but new versions arrive all the time: the Mirror filter, the Twins filter and, the apex of them all, the Symmetry filter, which seamlessly shows you what your face would look like if it were left-symmetrical, and when you tap the screen, right-symmetrical. The effect for most people is that one of the faces is more conventionally attractive than the other, which looks a little strange or â€œoffâ€<9d> (but of course, ironically, is also symmetrical). You might think Iâ€™m overstating the prominence of this preoccupation. TikTok is so vast, yet so personalized, that even a microtrend can seem universal, but this one has genuine reach: there are more than 100m TikToks with the tag #symmetricalface, and when I asked my Instagram followers if their feeds included people discussing facial symmetry, about 70% of 4,000-plus respondents said yes. No one can deny that TikTok invites a certain fixation with objectifying the self for the self. Filters can show you how old you look, your â€œtrueâ€<9d> eye color, which celebrity you most closely resemble, or â€œwhat youâ€™d look like if you were a 90s kidâ€<9d>. There is a searching quality to a lot of the content â€“ probably related to the fact that 60% of users are under 24 â€“ as if people are logging on to find themselves. Symmetry as an important beauty metric plays right into this. Of course I believed it, too, but it became clear to me as I watched people freak out over their asymmetry collectively that the fixation was absurd and misguided. Perfectly symmetrical faces look unnerving. Perfection, aesthetically, is boring almost by definition. There may be studies that show humans are drawn to symmetrical faces, but there are also studies that show the opposite. â€œIf you create a perfectly symmetrical face in the lab, which is what Iâ€™ve done, those faces have very low beauty ratings,â€<9d> Dahlia W Zaidel, a UCLA psychology professor, told Stephanie Shapiro in a 2006 article about the beauty of asymmetry for the Chicago Tribune. â€œWe never look at perfectly symmetrical faces, never from the minute we are born.â€<9d> When we herald symmetry as somehow divine, we forget the appeal of the real and organic, like someone you can squeeze versus something you can only perceive, like Lil Miquela. Obviously symmetry is easier on the eyes initially, but have you ever fallen in love with a crooked tooth or the strange way someoneâ€™s face moved when they talked? Peopleâ€™s most compelling traits are imperfect and incidental â€“ out of their control. â€œNature and design have proven that wonky objects can have even more charm, power, and adaptability than their mirrored neighbors,â€<9d> Dominic Muren, an industrial designer, told Shapiro. Thereâ€™s a reason musicians often leave flaws in their songs, and designers typically work with balance, rather than perfect symmetry in mind. Eyes and ears scan perfection, then catch and linger on the unexpected. I understand why we want clear answers to subjective questions, like whether weâ€™re likable or pleasant to look at. But the pursuit of perfection is wildly unsexy. Worse, itâ€™s boring. Our desperation to codify and commodify beauty has led us down a path of sensual decrepitude, of obsession and anxiety. It has supplied us with some of the least interesting role models of all time. We arenâ€™t meant to understand what makes us appealing to others, nor command it. Recently, I went to a Gang of Four show in Brooklyn and was blown away â€“ not by the music, but by Jon Kingâ€™s performance, which was like nothing Iâ€™d ever seen before. Completely lost in the moment, he jerked and jostled all over the stage, eyes shut tight, mouth twisted into an expression that would be humiliating if it werenâ€™t utterly true to him. It was captivating from start to finish. Iâ€™ve never watched someone on stage be so engaged with the audience and yet uninterested in how it was perceiving him. It occurred to me afterward that his lack of interest in trying to control his image was exactly what made him singular and life-affirming to watch. Watching him reminded me what it feels like to love something uncontrived. To be intrigued by something unusual on a personal, almost private level. Maybe we donâ€™t need to pursue such a tight grip over how everyone else sees us. Maybe beauty isnâ€™t something one should â€œpursueâ€<9d> at all. This is an edited excerpt of a piece that originally appeared in Maybe Baby, a newsletter about modern life, popular culture, and how we feel about both. Looking for more great work?

Constable Zachary Rolfe has begun giving evidence about the events leading up to the attempted arrest of Kumanjayi Walker. He was called as the first defence witness in the Northern Territory supreme court on Wednesday after the prosecution finished its case. The court previously heard that Rolfe shot Walker three times while trying to arrest him on 9 November 2019 in the remote community of Yuendumu, about 300km from Alice Springs. Walker, a 19-year-old Warlpiri man, had stabbed Rolfe with a pair of scissors shortly before the first shot was fired. Rolfe is not charged in relation to this shot. He is charged in relation to the second and third shots fired at Walker but has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers have argued his actions on the day were justified in light of the risk that Walker posed to him and a colleague, the then-constable Adam Eberl. Rolfe, 30, told the court that on the day of the shooting, when he was travelling from Alice Springs to Yuendumu, he recalled one comment he made in the car to a colleague from the Immediate Response Team (IRT) about the â€œmissionâ€<9d>. The IRT was a semi-tactical unit staffed by general duties officers who had received additional training and was often used to contain high-risk incidents or arrest high-risk offenders, Rolfe said. Rolfe said he told constable first class James Kirstenfeldt that he believed the IRT should have â€œbeen sent out earlierâ€<9d>, and clarified that he meant days earlier, because of the threat posed by Walker. Rolfe had earlier told the court that he had watched body-worn camera footage on 7 November 2019 of an incident involving Walker that had occurred the previous day. During that incident, Walker used an axe to threaten two Yuendumu police officers who had been attempting to arrest him. Rolfe told the court he formed the opinion from watching the video that Walker was â€œextremely violentâ€<9d> and had the potential to use â€œlethal weaponsâ€<9d> against police. He said he also felt the Yuendumu officers involved displayed â€œa perfect example of a human fear-based reactionâ€<9d> when Walker threatened them with an axe. Rolfe said he then spoke to Sgt Evan Kelly, who was his manager on the shift, about the axe incident, as he was concerned it was â€œbeing swept under the rugâ€<9d>. He clarified that what he meant by this was that it was the type of incident all officers in Alice Springs should be alerted to, as travel between Yuendumu and Alice Springs was common, and Walker therefore posed a threat to local police. Rolfe said Kelly agreed with this assessment. Rolfe said he also spoke with Sgt Lee Bauwens, the officer in charge of the IRT, that day. He said he informed Bauwens about the incident, and told him â€œI was of the mind that it was the sort of jobâ€<9d> the IRT should be called to. He said Bauwens agreed. Rolfe said that later that day he attended a house in an area of Alice Springs known as the Warlpiri camp, looking for Walker. Rolfe said he had found information on Walkerâ€™s police file linking him to the house in Warlpiri camp, but there was no indication when police attended that anyone was inside. Rolfe said that on the day of the shooting he received a phone call about half an hour before his shift was going to start from acting Sgt Shane McCormack informing him that he was being deployed with the IRT to Yuendumu. He said he asked McCormack twice what the mission in Yuendumu was, and was told on both occasions that it was to arrest Walker. He said McCormack told him there was no intelligence about the location of Walker since the axe incident, but that it was hoped Yuendumu sergeant Julie Frost would provide them with intelligence once they arrived. Rolfe told the court he met with the other three IRT officers who were being deployed to Yuendumu at Alice Springs police station and told them about this mission, Walkerâ€™s criminal history, and that nurses in the remote community had been evacuated earlier that day because of a spate of break-ins at their sleeping quarters. He said two of the officers did not know about the axe incident, so he played them footage of that before the team all left the station about 3.30pm. Rolfeâ€™s evidence finished on Wednesday before he was asked about the shooting. His evidence will continue on Thursday. Earlier on Wednesday, David Edwardson QC, for Rolfe, continued his cross-examination of Det Sr Sgt Andrew Barram. Edwardson asked Barram, an experienced officer who has held senior positions in NT police training and professional standards departments and wrote four reports on the shooting for the prosecution, about evidence he had given on Tuesday. Barram had said that Rolfe could have used â€œempty handâ€<9d> techniques to restrain Walker rather than shooting him a second and third time, as Walker was under the control of Eberl at the time. The court has previously heard that the second and third shots were fired while Eberl attempted to restrain Walker on a mattress after he stabbed Rolfe. Edwardson asked Walker about a police training manual that has been extensively referenced during the trial. In a section about officers being confronted with an edged weapon, under the headline Points That May Save Your Life, it stated â€œdo not use empty hand techniques unless it is not possible to use a firearmâ€<9d>. Edwardson asked Barram whether Rolfe had therefore acted consistently with his training when firing the second and third shots. Barram disagreed, saying Rolfe could have disengaged rather than shot Walker. â€œHe could have, and if he disengaged, Constable Eberl could be dead,â€<9d> Edwardson said. â€œNo he couldnâ€™t, no,â€<9d> Barram responded. Edwardson asked what would have happened if Walker had stabbed Eberl in the carotid artery. â€œHow was that going to happen in that position?â€<9d> Barram said. Edwardson responded, in reference to previous evidence Barram had given about not being able to see the arm holding the scissors in body-worn camera footage of the incident, â€œoh, senior sergeant, weâ€™ve been through that before, nothing further your honourâ€<9d>.

They have travelled thousands of miles to watch the Club World Cup and have been showing their colours with pride before Abel Ferreiraâ€™s side take on Chelsea, who will be making a big mistake if they show any complacency during Saturday nightâ€™s final at the Mohammed bin Zayed Stadium. This is a huge moment for Palmeiras; a chance, at long last, to silence taunts from rival Brazilian clubs about their barren record in this tournament. The Copa Libertadores champions understand what is at stake. They have long since had to accept that their triumph in the Copa Rio in 1951, the original intercontinental club tournament, is not enough to stop the chants of â€œPalmeiras nÃ£o tem Mundialâ€<9d> â€“ Palmeiras donâ€™t have a World Cup â€“ from fans of Corinthians, SÃ£o Paulo and Santos. There is only one way to scratch the itch: by defying the odds and dashing Chelseaâ€™s hopes of becoming world champions for the first time. History is on the line. This is the only major trophy that has eluded Chelsea during the Roman Abramovich era and the European champions do not need to be told how seriously this competition is taken in Brazil. They were beaten finalists when they faced Corinthians in 2012 and they know that Palmeirasâ€™s fans are going to turn the stadium green. â€œPalmeiras are huge,â€<9d> Thiago Silva, Chelseaâ€™s Brazilian centre-back, said. â€œWe know that with the presence of fans here, their team is much stronger.â€<9d> It is not going to be straightforward, although it looks increasingly likely that Thomas Tuchel will be at the final. The manager arrived in Abu Dhabi on Friday after a negative Covid test, having had to stay in London after contracting the virus, and will be on the touchline subject to the result of a further PCR test taken after he landed. Chelsea could do with him there. They did not convince when they beat Al-Hilal 1-0 on Wednesday and will be in trouble if there is no improvement against Palmeiras, who were comfortable 2-0 winners against Al-Ahly in the other semi-final. â€œIt is unfortunate Thomas was not here but we hope he will join us,â€<9d> Jorginho, Chelseaâ€™s vice-captain, said. â€œIt gives you more because he is your coach and there is more energy in the changing room.â€<9d> In the absence of Tuchel it has been up to the Germanâ€™s assistants, Zsolt Low and Arno Michels, to take charge. The backroom team have had to take on more responsibility. Anthony Barry and Benjamin Weber were both talked up by Jorginho and there has also been help from Petr Cech, Chelseaâ€™s technical and performance adviser. Cech has plenty of experience to offer Tuchelâ€™s squad. He was in goal when Chelsea lost to Corinthians in Japan just over nine years ago and the memory eats away at him. These opportunities do not come around often and Cech has been telling this generation not to fly home with regrets. The issue is that this tournament is still not taken entirely seriously by European teams. It is often viewed as an inconvenience, an unwanted interruption in the middle of a domestic campaign, but that can level the playing field and give hope to the underdogs. Chelsea certainly had the wrong attitude on the only other occasion when they were Europeâ€™s representatives in the Club World Cup. Too many of Rafael BenÃ­tezâ€™s players were unhappy with the quality of their hotel and the negativity affected their performance, Corinthians winning 1-0 thanks to a goal from Paolo Guerrero. It has to be different this time. Chelsea are staying in a plush hotel, the sun is shining and there were concerns that it would feel like a pre-season tour when they landed in Abu Dhabi. Would the intensity be there? Or would the players see it as a chance to relax after a taxing winter period? It has not been an easy few months for Chelsea. Injuries have disrupted their momentum, their title challenge has faded away and Romelu Lukaku still looks unconvincing. This, though, is a chance to lift the mood. Lukaku scored against Al-Hilal, Kepa Arrizabalaga made two brilliant saves and the sense in the coaching team is that the players understand what it would mean to become world champions. Palmeiras, who have won back-to-back Copa Libertadores titles, are not to be taken lightly. Tuchel, who does not want to leave anything to chance, is considering whether to bring Ã‰douard Mendy in for Arrizabalaga. Mason Mount and Nâ€™Golo KantÃ© could also return to the starting lineup and the message from Jorginho was that anything could happen. Palmeiras, who lost in the semi-finals last year, are going to be up for it. Chelsea must be ready.",FALSE,"pillar/sport","Sport"

This week, the Oxford quartet became the first British group to top Spotifyâ€™s global songs chart with their synthpop single Heat Waves, racking up 4.26m plays per day on the streaming platform. It was a feat their fans saw coming: last year, Heat Waves was the fourth most-streamed song in the US and the most-streamed in Australia, having been played more than 1bn times worldwide. This is a remarkable achievement for an act with no previous big hits â€“ but thatâ€™s not the only strange thing about their success. A sultry, wistful number with an extremely catchy chorus, Heat Waves has had an unusually slow rise to prominence: it was released in June 2020 and for months it failed to break into the UK Top 40 or US Billboard Hot 100. Its subsequent ascent up the charts â€“ peaking at No 5 in the UK, No 1 in Australia and No 3 in the US, where it currently stands â€“ was unprecedented in its leisurely nature; it now holds the record for the longest climb to the Top 5 in the US chartâ€™s history. Although the band werenâ€™t exactly languishing in obscurity â€“ 2014 single Gooey eventually went platinum in the US despite never actually breaking into the charts, while their 2016 album How to Be a Human Being was nominated for the Mercury prize â€“ even a year ago, it would have been difficult to imagine Glass Animals achieving the popularity they have today. Frontman and songwriter Dave Bayley wrote Heat Waves alone in the spring of 2019 in a recording studio complex in London. Or at least he thought he was by himself â€“ towards the end of his session he turned round to discover Johnny Depp was watching him. The actor, unfortunately, did not spot Heat Wavesâ€™ potential. â€œHe literally didnâ€™t react in any way to the song,â€<9d> recalls Bayley. â€œHe almost spoke to me afterwards as if there had been a fart in the room â€“ something weird and slightly negligible. There was no compliment.â€<9d> Initially, Bayley wasnâ€™t even sure he wanted to perform the song himself, and attempted to pitch it to another artist. Despite the trackâ€™s enormous success, he still thinks it may have worked better in somebody elseâ€™s voice. Thatâ€™s because the subject of the song is so personal he can barely perform it without crying: the bittersweet, nostalgic nature of the chord progression made him think of his best friend who died. Afterwards, he decided to make the lyrics more vague, so it could also apply â€œto a relationship situationâ€<9d> and appeal to a wider audience. â€œSongs that are insanely specific, I donâ€™t relate to as much,â€<9d> he says. Bayley was downbeat about its prospects in the run-up to the trackâ€™s release. The band had only just survived a very stressful period: the previous year, drummer Joe Seaward had sustained a serious head injury when he was hit by a lorry while cycling, and for a while it was unclear whether he would walk or talk again. Soon after his recovery â€“ and just as the band were preparing to release their third album, Dreamland â€“ the pandemic hit, plunging them straight back into the doldrums. â€œI was so worried,â€<9d> says Bayley. â€œIt immediately felt like there was no space in the world for new music. Everyone was listening to old music, finding comfort in the past. I was floored, for two weeks I just sat in my pants. My managers were like: you just have to put the record out and itâ€™s going to be a dud. Start writing the next one.â€<9d> In fact, Glass Animals did the opposite. There is no single secret to Heat Wavesâ€™ sleeper-hit success â€“ instead there were many minor individual efforts to drum up interest in the song. Bayley himself was behind some of the more off-the-cuff approaches, including an impromptu gig on a Hackney street corner that was cut short when the police â€œsweetlyâ€<9d> notified them that they were standing next to a sign that read â€œno musicâ€<9d>. More successful tactics included releasing the individual audio files from the album online so fans could remix the tracks. Helen Fleming, the bandâ€™s marketing manager at their label Polydor, says engaging audiences in such ways is now hugely important: â€œFan-created content is becoming more and more fundamental in how music travels so we knew weâ€™d want to lean into that.â€<9d> A TikTok trend has also helped Heat Waves gain popularity in recent months, with users soundtracking videos about absent loved ones with the song. Bayley describes the trend as â€œquite sad and sentimental which really fits the song â€“ Iâ€™ve seen some other TikTok trends where itâ€™s just someone putting mustard on a watermelon and jumping over milk crates.â€<9d> But by the time TikTok entered the frame, the song had been building an audience for more than a year thanks to its inclusion on the Fifa 21 soundtrack, its popularity on the video game Minecraft, and TV and radio promotion, says Fleming, meaning it â€œwas primed to explode in the way that it hasâ€<9d>. Modern methods aside, both Bayley and Fleming attribute a chunk of Heat Wavesâ€™ global popularity to the years Glass Animals spent touring the US, giving them a good foundation in a country where you actually need to be physically present, explains Fleming. Australian acclaim was also crucial. Heat Waves was voted the No 1 song of 2020 in the Triple J Hottest 100, the taste-making radio stationâ€™s annual music poll. Bayley thought it was so unlikely that the band would top the chart that he promised to get his first tattoo â€“ an outline of Australia on his bum â€“ if Glass Animals triumphed. He removed the bandages last week. Fleming says her team were also caught off-guard. â€œAt the beginning of the campaign we werenâ€™t talking about the singles chart,â€<9d> says Fleming. â€œItâ€™s unusual for a band to break a single in the way Glass Animals have.â€<9d> It is especially rare for an act with a traditional band set up to have a huge hit single nowadays. Over the past decade, the popularity of such groups has dived, in part due to the dominant cultural forces of pop, electronic music and rap, explains Hannah Ewens, Rolling Stone UKâ€™s features editor. Paradoxically, however, this also may be why Glass Animals have thrived. â€œTheir music doesnâ€™t really sound like guitar music or â€˜bandâ€™ music,â€<9d> says Ewens. â€œItâ€™s fairly close to being whatâ€™s been called Spotify-core: quite electronic, catchy, mid-tempo, muted, pensive but neutral in mood. The sort of inoffensive sound that could live on lots of playlists.â€<9d> Thanks to that broad appeal, Glass Animalsâ€™ rise looks set to be exponential. The band are currently awaiting next monthâ€™s Brit awards â€“ where they are up for song of the year and best rock act â€“ and the Grammys, where they have scored their first nomination, for best new artist. In the meantime, Bayley is taking some time off from Glass Animals, but not music-making. He is currently working with Jae5, best known for producing rapper J Husâ€™s work, as well as a female artist he cannot name, but who he describes as â€œone of my favourite songwriters of our generationâ€<9d>. Collaborating, he thinks, is â€œthe best way to learn: to see how other people work, and steal their tricks.â€<9d> After Heat Wavesâ€™ success, he may need to closely guard his own.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

Raquel Rosario SÃ¡nchez has launched civil action claiming the University of Bristol failed to protect her from harassment and bullying over her involvement with the campaign group Womanâ€™s Place UK. Bristol civil and family justice centre heard how the student notified the Russell Group university on 1 February 2018 that she wanted to make a complaint about â€œmalicious rumoursâ€<9d> she said were being spread about her. The court heard that activists had protested against a talk by Rosario SÃ¡nchez ahead of her hosting it, labelling her a â€œTerfâ€<9d> (trans-exclusionary radical feminist) and claiming she was â€œspreading hate about trans peopleâ€<9d>. Rosario SÃ¡nchez said: â€œI just felt very sad because I just want to live my life, go to campus and go to my centre and not have to face intimidation. In March 2018, I thought I was going to get that, but now knowing how long this has taken is making me sad.â€<9d> The district judge Alexander Ralton told the court he would assess whether the university handled the conflict between Rosario SÃ¡nchez and the activists correctly, and would not be making a judgment about gender rights. He said: â€œSome might regard proceedings as about trans rights and feminist rights, but the proceedings are not about that. This case is about Bristol Universityâ€™s handling of conflict. I am sure counsel would say itâ€™s a lot more complicated than that, and indeed it is, but this is the heart of the matter.â€<9d> Rosario SÃ¡nchez began her PhD course at the University of Bristol in January 2018. A Womanâ€™s Place UK describes its aim as â€œto end to violence, harassment and abuse of women and girlsâ€<9d>. Critics argue that the campaign seeks to limit trans peopleâ€™s rights and dismisses the validity of some trans peopleâ€™s gender identity. On a crowdfunding page set up to raise money for her legal battle, Rosario SÃ¡nchez describes herself as a â€œfeminist writer, campaigner and researcherâ€<9d>. In a blogpost written ahead of the hearing, she claimed: â€œIdeological puritans staffing the universityâ€™s diversity and inclusion office have sought to erase virtually any term that communicates the reality of female biology.â€<9d> She said a whistleblower at the university told her she had been reported to human resources for saying: â€œYou have to have a uterus to give birth.â€<9d> A University of Bristol spokesperson said: â€œMs Rosario SÃ¡nchez has chosen to take legal action against the university.

That and the fact that both mother and child are witch-like creatures called hellbenders who live for many decades, feed off mostly moss and seed cones, and reproduce asexually like ferns. But theyâ€™re happy together, mostly: they have a mini punk band, in which Izzy plays the drums (sheâ€™s pretty good), mum plays a mean bass, and they sing songs about the apocalypse and murdering while wearing face paint. Itâ€™s not exactly clear how they afford petrol or pay for new picks and drum sticks when needed, but maybe the cash is harvested from the hikers who wander accidentally on to their land and get vaporised by the motherâ€™s supernatural powers, as does one hapless stranger played by John Adams. The power dynamics shift in this Rapunzel-like set-up when Izzy meets another teenage girl, a regular sort named Amber (Lulu Adams) who just happens to be the niece of a hiker mum recently dusted. Through Amber she meets some other teens, and starts to wonder if the isolation sheâ€™s been kept in all this time was strictly necessary. Eating a worm on a dare leads Izzy to realise she has supernatural powers that get stronger if she consumes another creatureâ€™s life force. Soon, sheâ€™s wanting to go into town by herself, giving up their vegetarian diet, and building a meaty tunnel in the basement, sort of like a huge vagina or a gullet, in which to eat her prey. Kids, they grow up so fast! Although made on a tiny budget, this highly original exercise in folk horror punches well above its weight with snappy dialogue, trippy visual effects and impressive camerawork. But the most adorable thing about it is that itâ€™s a family affair: John Adams and Toby Poser are married; Zelda and Lula Adams are their children. All of them took turns working on the crew when they werenâ€™t in a scene, a working method the clan developed in their earlier features, Halfway to Zen and Rumblestrips. The Adams family shot this in lockdown; itâ€™s a pretty impressive family venture given most of us barely managed to get our own kids interested in board games. â€¢ Hellbender is available on 24 February on Shudder.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

Itâ€™s a lot of talk, say sceptical Wolverhampton public","https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/02/levelling-up-its-a-lot-of-talk-say-sceptical-wolverhampton-public","https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/feb/02/levelling-up-its-a-lot-of-talk-say-sceptical-wolverhampton-public","It may have been dominating conversation in Westminster on Wednesday, but questions about levelling up were met with blank stares among shoppers on Wednesfieldâ€™s high street in Wolverhampton. Most had never heard of the concept, while of those who had, many doubted it would do much to improve their quality of life. â€œDoes levelling up just mean the whole country will be the same level of poor together?â€<9d> said Gary Green, 56, who has worked on the streetâ€™s fruit and veg stall for 22 years. â€œWhatever we gain in levelling up, weâ€™ll lose more with taxes going up, energy prices are devastating everybody. They are 100% out of touch. How can anyone make a living and survive when everything is going through the roof?â€<9d> Just outside the city centre, Wednesfield sits in Wolverhampton North East, one of a number of former â€œred wallâ€<9d> seats that voted Conservative in the last general election. Green said he had â€œvoted Conservative my whole life but I wouldnâ€™t vote for them againâ€<9d>, adding that he doubted levelling up would do enough to cut through anger over the cost of living and the long-term economic impact of Covid. The city of Wolverhampton has been promoted by the government as a key beneficiary of its new strategy, and was one of the first areas to be prioritised for a share of a Â£1.5bn brownfield fund. It was home to the first new government HQ outside London, when the housing ministry opened a site there last year. â€œWe want a government as focused on Wolverhampton as it is on Westminster,â€<9d> proclaimed the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, on Wednesday morning before the publication of a white paper. Ian Brookfield, the Labour leader of Wolverhampton council, said: â€œIt would be cheerless of me not to welcome it, weâ€™ve been starved for so long. Of course Iâ€™m grateful for anything that we receive. But will it make up for the past 10 years of budget cuts? Probably not.â€<9d> In Wednesfield, many shoppers were also sceptical about the real-world impact of the policy. Sharon Gunter, 55, a retail worker, said she knew little about the white paper and would â€œbelieve it when I see it happeningâ€<9d>. â€œItâ€™s a lot of talk. Iâ€™m very disheartened with things at the moment,â€<9d> she said. â€œTheyâ€™ll say theyâ€™re doing this [levelling up] to try to distract from whatâ€™s going on and make people forget about the parties scandal.â€<9d> Others, although sketchy on the details, were more hopeful about the potential of the levelling up agenda to bring some needed investment to the area. â€œIt sounds positive, Iâ€™m optimistic,â€<9d> said Adil Chutoo, 67, a nurse. â€œI feel they are trying to help. We need more investment around here, people are struggling. The traditional high street is gradually dying. The intentions are there; whether they become actions, we donâ€™t know.â€<9d> Kim Denny, 60, shopping with her mother, said: â€œYou look around and things arenâ€™t the same as they used to be. Shops are shutting, this used to be a lovely little vibrant town and itâ€™s not like that any more. So I think levelling up sounds like a great idea, I just donâ€™t know much about it.â€<9d> Brookfield said he was not surprised that so many people knew little about what levelling up means. â€œThis is infrastructure-led levelling up, it is not people-based. People doesnâ€™t know what it means for them and just wave it away,â€<9d> he said. â€œThereâ€™s going to be cataclysmic events later on this year with the energy crisis and cost of living. Of course we could do with a new building here and there, but its people who need to be looked after first.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

You can find our continuing coverage here. Ukrainian internet is experiencing serious disruptions as the fighting continues, according to a network monitoring organisation. The report said it had confirmed â€œsignificant disruptionsâ€<9d> in Kharkiv on Thursday and further disruptions have been tracked across Ukraine, reaching Kyiv on Saturday morning with a â€œmajor disruptionâ€<9d> registered to GigaTrans, Ukraineâ€™s â€œbackbone internet provider... which supplies connectivity to several other networksâ€<9d>. â€œWhile connectivity does remain available through other routes, the incident is likely to have a significant impact on infrastructure, limiting citizensâ€™ ability to communicate,â€<9d> it said. â€œWork is ongoing to assess the incidents and their contexts. Telecoms disruptions in Ukraine have so far been attributed to power outages, cyberattacks, sabotage, and kinetic impacts.â€<9d> So far there is still contact coming out of Kyiv, including social media posts, pictures and photos, and some of those posting from the city say they havenâ€™t experienced any trouble, so the extend of the disruption still seems unclear. Japan is considering imposing economic sanctions on Belarus for its support of Russiaâ€™s invasion, Reuters is reporting. Citing two officials, the report said Tokyo will coordinate with other G7 governments, but there were no other details about the specifics. It said Japanâ€™s foreign ministry declined to comment. US sanctions already announced against Belarus include 24 Belarusian individuals and entities. A short time ago, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he had spoken with Japanâ€™s foreign minister about â€œhow we are standing together with Allies and partners to hold Russia accountable for its illegal, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on Ukraineâ€<9d>. â€œJapan is helping to lead a coalition of partners and allies in response.â€<9d> Japan has already announced sanctions on Russia over the invasion, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida terming Moscowâ€™s moves an unacceptable violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and international law. Kira Rudik is a Ukrainian parliamentarian currently in Kyiv. Sheâ€™s just spoken to CNN, saying it is strange to go from working as a member of parliament, under the threat of Russian attack, and then to have it suddenly start. â€œThen you know you have to do something,â€<9d> she says. â€œThatâ€™s when you get a gun and you learn how to shoot it. You understand you have to get a group of resistance, which we did, and now we are helping our army to fight Russian soldiers who are trying to take Kyiv right now as I am talking to you.â€<9d> Rudik says this is the â€œnew realityâ€<9d>. â€œWe are not leaving. This is our town and this is our country, and no Putin soldiers will tell us how to live.â€<9d> A report from the Reuters news agency suggests it is looking more likely that Russia could be excluded from the Swift global bank payments system â€“ a step that some countries had been reluctant to take: Germany and Italy softened their opposition against kicking Russia out of the worldâ€™s main international payments network, US and European officials said. Doing so would hit Russian trade and make it harder for Russian companies to do business. Italy, which had been reluctant to take that step, on Friday said it would not veto proposals to ban Russia and pledged to continue working in unison with its EU partners. Germany, which has the EUâ€™s biggest trade flows with Russia, is also open to banning Russia from Swift, but must calculate the consequences for its economy, said its finance minister, Christian Lindner. Justin Trudeau, Canadaâ€™s PM, and Boris Johnson in Britain want Russia removed from Swift immediately. It would mark be a significant escalation of sanctions already imposed against Russia and its leadership, including some aimed personally at Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. Fighting is in the east, west and south of Kyiv, according to multiple reports. â€œAll of this is now happening within the city limits,â€<9d> reports CNNâ€™s Clarissa Ward, but it doesnâ€™t appear to have reached the centre. There are no signs of residential areas being targeted yet, she says, â€œbut weâ€™re hearing a lot of explosions from many different directions.â€<9d> Interfax Ukraine news agency reports Russian forces have tried to attack an electricity-generating station, while the Ukrainian military says it has repelled an attack on a Kyiv army base, according to Reuters. The Ukrainian government also says it stopped a Russian advancement down Peremohy Avenue - which runs past the Beresteiska metro station, where heavy fighting has also been reported. The Guardian has not independently verified the reports. The assault appears to line up with Zelenskiyâ€™s warning that tonight could see Russiaâ€™s attempt to storm the city. Three million people call Kyiv home. Earlier Zelensky posted a video from the streets in Kyiv. â€œTonight, they will launch an assault. All of us must understand what awaits us. We must withstand this night,â€<9d> he said. â€œThe fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.â€<9d> Guatemala has recalled its ambassador from Russia. The central American countryâ€™s president Alejandro Giammattei said on Friday that he had ordered the return of Guisela Atalida Godinez Sazo, adding that his government rejected Russiaâ€™s actions in Ukraine. Giammattei had earlier expressed â€œfull support for the sovereignty of Ukraine as like-minded countries and stand in solidarity with its people and government.â€<9d> Kazakhstan is denying a request for its troops to join the Russian offensive, NBC has reported. The former Soviet Republic state has also refused to join Putinâ€™s recognition of Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states, his pretext for the hostility. A significant and interesting move here, from one of Russiaâ€™s closest allies. There are mounting witness reports now of artillery and fire in Kyiv now. One person told Reuters they could hear artillery blasts coming from an unspecified location somewhere near the city centre. A reporter for the Kyiv Independent is reporting â€œextremely hard combatâ€<9d> near the Kyiv Zoo - the Guardian has not verified this. The Washington Postâ€™s correspondent in Kyiv is reporting â€œdozens and dozensâ€<9d> of explosions heard. BBC has also reported a large explosion heard in Maidan square, and multiple blasts in Troieshchyna, where that thermal power station is. Burning vehicles have also been seen on Kyivâ€™s Peremonhy Ave. Nick Walsh, CNNâ€™s reporter in Kherson, in the south of the country reports heavy fighting over a key bridge as Russian forces move through the area. â€œLocals here weâ€™ve spoken to are terrified,â€<9d> he says. Central Kyiv is deserted tonight: There are sporadic reports of heavy fighting around Kyiv right now. A CNN reporter in the capital says there is heavy fighting in Obolon in the cityâ€™s north, while other reports note clashes in Vasylkiv, in the southwest outskirts. Just over the river to the East is Troieshchyna where there are several reports of Russian forces attacking a thermal power station. Itâ€™s the second time in 24 hours Russia has targeted the power plant, and Ukrainian forces are attempting to repel them, according to the Kyiv Independent. The Guardian has not independently verified these reports, which have come through in just the last few minutes. Australia plans to join allies in personally sanctioning Vladimir Putin and Russiaâ€™s foreign affairs minister, Sergei Lavrov. However it is not currently planning to expel Russian diplomats. A few hours ago Australian foreign minister Marise Payne said she was taking advice from her department on expanding sanctions to include the Russian president, who would be â€œpersonally responsible for the deaths and the suffering of innocent Ukrainiansâ€<9d>. Payne said while sanctioning a countryâ€™s leader was an exceptional step, the Russian invasion of Ukraine was â€œan exceptional situationâ€<9d>. â€œIt is clear that the only way to exact a cost for those actions is to ensure that he, himself, shares some of that cost and some of the pain that he is inflicting on everyone else around him in Ukraine.â€<9d> Read more here. Ukraine has asked Appleâ€™s chief executive, Tim Cook, to cut Russia off from the App Store and Apple products. Mykhailo Federov, the countryâ€™s vice prime minister and the minister of digital transformation, has published the letter he sent on Friday, appealing for Cook to bolster the impact of government-level sanctions. The whole world is repelling the aggressor through the imposition of sanctions - the enemy must suffer significant losses. But we need your support - in 2022 modern technology is perhaps the best answer to the tanks, multiple rocket launchers (hrad) and missiles... I appeal to you and I am sure that you will not only hear, but do everything possible to protect Ukrainem Europe, ad finally, the entire democratic world from bloody authoritarian aggression - to stop supplying Apple services and products to the Russian Federation, including blocking access to the App Store! We are sure that such actions will motivate youth and active population of Russia to proactively stope the disgraceful military aggression. Hello, this is Helen Davidson taking over the reins of the liveblog for the next few hours. Stay with us for the latest developments as Ukraine enters a night that its leader has predicted will be â€œharder than the dayâ€<9d>, as Russian forces threaten Kyiv. In Kyiv, a woman has reportedly given birth in an underground metro station, where sheâ€™d been sheltering with other residents. Trains and platforms have been staying open to assist people, with many people taking cover. This post was amended to remove incorrect details, which had beentaken from an earlier and unrelated report. The day focused on the capital, Kyiv. Russian forces entered the cityâ€™s outskirts on Friday and were threatening the Ukrainian capital from the north-west and east in a lightning attack apparently aimed at seizing the city. The Russian defence ministry claimed its forces had taken control of the strategic Hostomel airfield to the north-west, while Russian tanks were filmed by locals in the Obolonskyi district about six miles north of the city centre in the morning. Vladimir Putin urged the Ukrainian army to overthrow its leadership, whom he labelled as a â€œgang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who have has lodged itself in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people.â€<9d> The US department of defense has confirmed that a Russian â€œamphibious assaultâ€<9d> has been launched in Mariupol, a coastal city in south-east Ukraine. â€œThis night will be harder than the day. Many cities of our state are under attack: Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, our boys and girls in the Donbas, the cities of the south, special attention to Kyiv,â€<9d>said the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy . â€œWe canâ€™t lose the capital.â€<9d> Zelenskiy pleaded for international help and for western powers to act faster to cut off Russiaâ€™s economy and provide Ukraine with military assistance. â€œWhen bombs fall on Kyiv, it happens in Europe, not just in Ukraine,â€<9d> he said. â€œWhen missiles kill our people, they kill all Europeans.â€<9d> Nato will deploy significant extra troops to countries in eastern Europe who are part of the alliance, its secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said. UK ministers warned there would be no forces going to Ukraine itself to avoid an â€œexistentialâ€<9d> war between Russia and the west. The EU and the UK moved to freeze foreign-held assets of Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. The initiative is largely symbolic but the move by Brussels and Downing Street followed recognition that appeals for action from Volodymyr Zelenskiy had to be heard. The UN security council voted on a resolution deploring Russian invasion of UkraineEleven member states voted for the resolution, three abstained (China, India, and UAE) and one voted against (Russia). As Russia holds a veto the resolution was not upheld. The Council of Europe suspended Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The 47-nation council announced that Russia was suspended with â€œimmediate effectâ€<9d> from the organisationâ€™s committee of ministers and parliamentary assembly on Friday â€œas a result of the Russian Federationâ€™s armed attack on Ukraineâ€<9d>. Russia will no longer be allowed to compete in this yearâ€™s Eurovision song contest, with organisers saying its inclusion could â€œbring the competition into disreputeâ€<9d>. The US treasury has imposed sanctions on Vladimir Putin and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov. â€œThe United States, in coordination with allies and partners, continued to forcefully respond to Russiaâ€™s unjustified, unprovoked, and premediated invasion of Ukraine,â€<9d> the department said in a statement. â€œIf necessary, we are prepared to impose further costs on Russia for its appalling behavior on the world stage,â€<9d> said secretary of the treasury Janet Yellen. The UN security council voted on a resolution deploring Russian invasion of Ukraine. Eleven member states voted for the resolution, three abstained (China, India, and UAE) and one voted against (Russia). As Russia holds a veto the resolution was not upheld. But the US and its allies will see it as a victory to have Russia voting alone, and China abstaining. They were able to bring China on board by softening the resolution slightly, changing the word â€˜condemningâ€™ to â€˜deploringâ€™ for example and removing a reference to the Russian president. It is a loss however not to persuade India or UAE off the fence. Vasily Nebenzya, the Russian permanent representative is chairing the Security Council meeting and is reading out all the countries sponsoring a resolution deploring Russiaâ€™s invasion. It is a very, very long list. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, said that â€œRussiaâ€™s latest attack on our most fundamental principles is so bold, so brazen, that it threatens our international system as we know it.â€<9d> â€œOne country is invading another. Russia is the aggressor here,â€<9d> she added. â€œThere is no middle ground.â€<9d> The Albanian permanent representative, Ferit Hoxha, said Russia â€œhas stained the UN Charter with innocent blood.â€<9d> â€œThis is a defining moment for the council...Future generations will know who stood up for the respect of human life, for international law,â€<9d> he said. And Mexicoâ€™s Juan RamÃ³n de la Fuente noted, in support of the resolution: â€œMexico has itself suffered four invasions over the course of its history as an independent stateâ€<9d> twice by France, twice by the US. Ukrainian media are reporting gunfire in Kyiv. In the meantime, the defence ministry has advised Kyiv residents to make petrol bombs to repel invaders, Reuters is reporting. Zelenskiy had a dire message for Ukrainians tonight : â€œThis night will be the hardest... We must withstand,â€<9d> he said in an address. â€œThis night the enemy will be using all available means to break our resistance. This night they will launch an assault.â€<9d> â€œThis night will be harder than the day. Many cities of our state are under attack: Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, our boys and girls in the Donbas, the cities of the south, special attention to Kyiv,â€<9d> he added. â€œWe canâ€™t lose the capital.â€<9d> The US department of defense has confirmed that a Russian â€œamphibious assaultâ€<9d> has been launched in Mariupol, a coastal city in south-east Ukraine. We do believe that such an assault is being conducted today but we dont have perfect visibility on the progress of that,â€<9d> John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said. â€œIt certainly appears to us to be a piece of their designs in the south to further cut off the Donbas region and to â€“ from a southern perspective â€“ continue to try to take population centers.â€<9d> Speaking in a press briefing at the Pentagon on Friday afternoon, Kirby was also asked about a direct threat issued by Russia to Finland and Sweden, which have been considering joining Nato. A Russia foreign ministry spokeswoman said the countriesâ€™ â€œaccession to Nato can have detrimental consequences â€¦ and face military and political consequencesâ€<9d>. Kirby said: â€œThat would be extremely destabilizingâ€<9d>, but said there was no indication â€œthat is necessarily in the offingâ€<9d>. Kirby said during the Ukraine conflict Nato has been prepared to â€œstep up in ways that truly are historic and significantâ€<9d>. â€œThe secretary [of defense] said it best: Mr Putin is getting exactly what he says he didnâ€™t want: a strong Nato on his western flank,â€<9d> Kirby said. â€œSo without speaking to Finland specifically, we stand up for sovereignty and territorial integrity of independent nation states. Thatâ€™s not going to change, and Mr Putin, should he want to violate that in new ways, will find new costs, Iâ€™m sure, imposed upon him.â€<9d> Regarding the threat Russia could pose to countries other than the Ukraine, Kirby said: â€œItâ€™s not entirely clear if Mr Putin has designs beyond Ukraine, and itâ€™s because that is not perfectly clear that we continue to look for ways to bolster our Nato capabilities and to reassure our allies.â€<9d> A spokesman for the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy suggested that a negotiated settlement was still possible, Reuters reported. â€œUkraine was and remains ready to talk about a ceasefire and peace,â€<9d> spokesman Sergii Nykyforov added. Earlier today, the US State department cast doubts about whether Russia had legitimate plans for diplomacy, saying that Russia must stop bombing Ukraine first. â€œNow we see Moscow suggesting that diplomacy take place at the barrel of a gun, or as Moscowâ€™s rockets, mortars, artillery target the Ukrainian people,â€<9d> said the US state department spokesperson Ned Price. â€œThis is not real diplomacy. Those are not the conditions for real diplomacy.â€<9d> Those on the ground in Kyiv are reporting an air raid warning happening in the capital with multiple air strikes occurring. From Buzzfeed News reporter Christopher Miller: Air raid warning in Kyiv. And missiles being fired on the capital. Iâ€™ve counted three large strikes in past five minutes. Watching from my window and seeing the sky light up; roar of explosions reverberating across the city. US President Joe Biden will directly sanction Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top Russian officials for Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, confirmed White House press secretary Jen Psaki. Bidenâ€™s decision to personally sanction Putin follows an announcement from the EU today that Putin and the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, will be personally sanctioned following Russiaâ€™s attacks. Psaki went on to say that sanctioning Putin personally has remained an option and that Biden came to that decision â€œover the last day or soâ€<9d> in coordination with European allies. Psaki also said that she believes personal sanctions against Putin could prevent him from traveling to the US, reported CNN. Anonymous announced on Twitter today that they had reportedly hacked the database of the Russian Ministry of Defence website, breaching and leaking the private data. From the Anonymous Twitter account: JUST IN: Hacktivist group #Anonymous has successfully breached and leaked the database of the Russian Ministry of Defence website | mil[.]ru |. In the same tweet, the group also posted screenshots of the reported data and provided a link where users could access it. Russia Today, the countryâ€™s state-sponsored media source, confirmed that they had experienced a cyberattack following a â€œcyber warâ€<9d> declaration from Anonymous after a request for cyber defense volunteers from the Ukrainian government: â€œAfter the statement by Anonymous, RTâ€™s websites became the subject of massive DDoS attacks from some 100 million devices, mostly based in the US. Due to the attacks there might be temporary website access limitations for some users, yet RT is promptly resolving these issues.â€<9d> Ukrainian officials, in turn, said today that they have also experienced hacks, but from Belarus, targeting the private email addresses of Ukrainian military personnel â€œand related individuals,â€<9d> reported Reuters. Another glimpse of what life is like for Ukrainian residents from the Guardianâ€™s Shaun Walker, who is currently near Kyiv: Iâ€™ve just driven back across Ukraine from Lviv to close to Kyiv. A lonely drive in my direction but still packed roads going west as many escape from the Russian military action. At the border between Lviv and Rivne regions, a few hoursâ€™ drive from the western border with Poland, there was a queue stretching back several miles as soldiers checked documents. Closer to Kyiv, many people are avoiding the main roads west out of the capital due to the fact that some Russians are expected to come in that way, and are taking the back roads to the south. Along these roads Iâ€™ve just seen locals building makeshift checkpoints and barricades of sandbags. On the radio, one of the items on the news was instructions on how to make Molotov cocktails. Video was posted on social media of Ukrainian TV anchors reporting live from bomb shelters due to ongoing fighting throughout the country. From journalist and writer Maksym Eristavi: Satellite images taken today showed several large deployments of troops and about 150 transport helicopters in the south of Belarus, said a private US company, reported Reuters: The images showed one large helicopter deployment near the Belarusian town of Chojniki, which had over 90 helicopters parked on a road with the deployment extending for more than five miles. Images also showed a large deployment of ground forces with several hundred vehicles in convoy position in several fields. The images released by Maxar Technologies, which has been tracking the buildup of Russian forces for weeks, could not be independently verified by Reuters. Hereâ€™s a summary of todayâ€™s events on the second day of Russiaâ€™s full-scale invasion of Ukraine: The day focused on the capital, Kyiv. Russian forces entered the cityâ€™s outskirts on Friday and were threatening the Ukrainian capital from the north-west and east in a lightning attack apparently aimed at seizing the city. The Russian defence ministry claimed its forces had taken control of the strategic Hostomel airfield to the north-west, while Russian tanks were filmed by locals in the Obolonskyi district about six miles north of the city centre in the morning. Vladimir Putin urged the Ukrainian army to overthrow its leadership, whom he labelled as a â€œgang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who have has lodged itself in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people.â€<9d> A senior US defence source briefed Pentagon reporters that they believed Russia had launched an amphibious landing with thousands of naval infantry to the west of the key southern coastal city of Mariupol. President Zelenskiy pleaded for international help and for western powers to act faster to cut off Russiaâ€™s economy and provide Ukraine with military assistance. â€œWhen bombs fall on Kyiv, it happens in Europe, not just in Ukraine,â€<9d> he said. â€œWhen missiles kill our people, they kill all Europeans.â€<9d> Nato will deploy significant extra troops to countries in eastern Europe who are part of the alliance, its secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said. UK ministers warned there would be no forces going to Ukraine itself to avoid an â€œexistentialâ€<9d> war between Russia and the west. The EU and the UK moved to freeze foreign-held assets of Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. The initiative is largely symbolic but the move by Brussels and Downing Street followed recognition that appeals for action from Volodymyr Zelenskiy had to be heard. The Council of Europe suspended Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The 47-nation council announced that Russia was suspended with â€œimmediate effectâ€<9d> from the organisationâ€™s committee of ministers and parliamentary assembly on Friday â€œas a result of the Russian Federationâ€™s armed attack on Ukraineâ€<9d>. Russia will no longer be allowed to compete in this yearâ€™s Eurovision song contest, with organisers saying its inclusion could â€œbring the competition into disreputeâ€<9d>. The Ukrainian ambassador to the US said today that attacks from Russia on Ukraine have â€œbeen more brutalâ€<9d>, but that Russian forces did not advanced as planned. â€œThe enemy is clearly surprised by the result of the armed forces and volunteers to protect the integrity of our country,â€<9d> said Oksana Markarova, who is currently speaking at the the embassy of Ukraine in Washington DC. Markarova also said that Ukrainian authorities are gathering evidence of â€œcrimesâ€<9d> by Russian authorities to submit to international tribunals. On the Chernobyl power plant that Russian troops captured yesterday, Markarova said that responsibility for it now lies with Russia as strict regulations for the plant are not being observed, adding that 92 plant personnel were taken as hostages. Markarova also confirmed that Russian troops hit an orphanage in Ukraine, but did not injure any of the 50 children that were inside. The Russian army has reportedly destroyed the Kyiv thermal power plant, says Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko, a sign that Russiaâ€™s army is targeting critical infrastructure in the capital city. This announcement follows another report from Klitschko that five blasts were heard in three to five minutes near a power station located north of Kyiv, reported the Telegraph. â€œThe emergency services are under way. Weâ€™re finding out the details,â€<9d> said Klitschko of the five blasts. â€œThe situation now â€“ without exaggeration â€“ is threatening for Kyiv. The night, close to the morning, will be very difficult.â€<9d> Boris Johnson has recorded a video in which he aims to speak to both Ukrainians and Russians after a phone call with Ukraineâ€™s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy this morning, ITV News reports. The video â€“ in which he describes the invasion as a tragedy for Ukraine and Russia â€“ was recorded after the PM held a phone call this morning with the Ukrainian leader. Speaking in Russian, the prime minister says: To my Russian friends I do not believe this war is in your name. It does not have to be this way. In a recording that will be released this evening, Johnson also says in Ukrainian: This crisis, this tragedy, can and must come to an end because the world needs a free and sovereign Ukraine. There are reports of loud explosions in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. A Reuters witness said artillery rounds have been heard in the capital. Another witness told the news agency that there was intense gunfire in western part of Kyiv. Kyivâ€™s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, writes that five blasts within three and five minutes were heard near a power station in the north of the city. The UK will â€œimminentlyâ€<9d> level personal sanctions against Russiaâ€™s president Vladimir Putin and foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, Boris Johnson has said. Johnsonâ€™s announcement echoes measures announced by the EU to target the Russian leader. According to a No 10 spokesperson, Johnson told allies the UK would introduce sanctions against President Putin and foreign minister Sergei Lavrov imminently, on top of the sanctions package the UK announced yesterday. The PM also used the meeting to urge â€œimmediate actionâ€<9d> over the banning of Russia from the Swift payment system to â€œinflict maximum painâ€<9d> on the Kremlin, they said. The missile left a crater two metresâ€™ deep, twisted shards of metal beside a playground slide, and shattered glass below the windows of a nearby kindergarten, the Guardianâ€™s correspondent in Kyiv, Emma Graham-Harrison, reports. In one apartment block 10 floors of kitchens, living rooms and bedrooms sat open to the skies, their balconies, doors and windows broken off or shattered into pieces by the weapon that brought the Russian invasion to this corner of the city. The missile hit soon after 4am on Friday, before Russian troops reached the city outskirts, or Ukrainian troops set up defensive positions in its historic centre. â€œPeople are grieving. This is already a tragedy,â€<9d> said Gorban Abasov, a 70-year-old singer. Most of the people who lived there were pensioners like him, he said, none had army links and nearby buildings were civilian as well. There was no reason for such a lethal weapon to land here, but none of those gathered to inspect the damage seemed surprised that civilians were already in the line of fire, even before the battle for Kyiv had really begun. After all, there was no reason for Russian troops to be in their country, beyond the terrifying whim of an ageing autocrat. As Abasov stared at the ruins of his home, Ukrainian soldiers were already taking up position in Kyivâ€™s historic centre and its strategic bridges across the Dnieper and fighting advance Russian forces on its outskirts. Britain believes Russiaâ€™s goal is to encircle Kyiv in the coming hours and days and effect â€œregime changeâ€<9d> which intelligence officials warned could be achieved by killing or capturing President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the countryâ€™s leadership, the Guardianâ€™s Dan Sabbagh writes. Western officials cited Russian president Vladimir Putinâ€™s aggressive rhetoric from earlier on Friday, in which he called on the Ukrainian army to revolt and rid the country of â€œthis gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazisâ€<9d>. The official added: Itâ€™s clear the kind of vitriol coming from Russia about the Ukrainian leadership, so I think we can expect that they would be targets for Russian forces coming into the city. Previously US and to a lesser extent British intelligence have warned that Russiaâ€™s spy agencies have drawn up â€œkill listsâ€<9d> of key figures, who would be targeted by Moscow if their forces take control of the key cities. The western assessment is that â€œthe bulk of Russiaâ€™s armoured forcesâ€<9d> aiming for Kyiv from the north west and north east remain more than 50km away at present, although some advance forces have reached the north western suburbs, near the Hostomel airport. Although the airfield was claimed to have been captured by Russia, it appears to have been too badly damaged in the fighting to be usable to fly in reinforcements, the officials indicated. The timing of any Russian planned encirclement of Ukraineâ€™s capital would depend on â€œthe level of resistanceâ€<9d> put up by the Ukrainian forces who have largely sought to halt the Russian advance in built up areas. Ukraineâ€™s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and US president Joe Biden discussed the US providing â€œconcrete defence assistanceâ€<9d>, according to Zelenskiy. The Kremlinâ€™s objectives are not limited to Ukraine, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg says. He describes Putinâ€™s decision to pursue aggression against Ukraine as a â€œterrible strategic mistakeâ€<9d> for which Russia would pay a â€œsevere price for years to comeâ€<9d>. We are facing a new normal in European security. Nato allies and the EU have already introduced significant sanctions and must stand ready â€œto do moreâ€<9d>, he says. Even if it means we have to pay a price because we are in this for the long haul. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg is holding a news conference after world leaders held a meeting to discuss the ongoing crisis. Russia has â€œshattered the peace of Europeâ€<9d>, he says. The people of Ukraine are fighting for their freedom in the face of Russiaâ€™s unprovoked invasion. We deplore the tragic loss of life, enormous human suffering and destruction. He called on Russia to stop the â€œsenselessâ€<9d> war. Nato member countries will deploy more troops to eastern Europe, world leaders said. In a joint statement after a virtual summit chaired by secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, the 30 Nato leaders described Russiaâ€™s attack on Ukraine as â€œbrutal and wholly unprovoked and unjustifiedâ€<9d>. We deplore the tragic loss of life, enormous human suffering and destruction caused by Russiaâ€™s actions. Peace on the European continent has been fundamentally shattered. The world will hold Russia, as well as Belarus, accountable for their actions, they continued, as they called on states to condemn this â€œunconscionable attackâ€<9d>. No one should be fooled by the Russian governmentâ€™s barrage of lies. The statement continues: We have deployed defensive land and air forces in the eastern part of the Alliance, and maritime assets across the Nato area. We have activated Natoâ€™s defence plans to prepare ourselves to respond to a range of contingencies and secure Alliance territory, including by drawing on our response forces. We are now making significant additional defensive deployments of forces to the eastern part of the alliance. Russiaâ€™s communications watchdog Roskomnadzor on Friday said it was partially restricting access to Meta Platforms (FB.O) Facebook in response to restrictions the US social media giant has imposed on Russian media, accusing Facebook of censorship, Pjotr Sauer writes. â€œOn February 25, the prosecutor generalâ€™s office, in agreement with the foreign ministry, decided that the social network Facebook is involved in the violation of fundamental human rights and freedoms, as well as the rights and freedoms of Russian citizens,â€<9d> a statement of the Roskomnadzor website said, adding that starting from today, measures would be taken to â€œpartially restrict accessâ€<9d> to Facebook. It was not immediately clear what the restrictions would involve. Russia has recently turned up the pressure on western social media giants. Last year, the country slowed down the operations of Twitter, after it was accused of failing to remove illegal content. Kremlin critics have previously warned that a potential invasion of Ukraine could have negative consequences for Russiaâ€™s civil society. â€œAny potential military action of any scale puts Navalnyâ€™s life at greatest risk yet,â€<9d> Maria Pevchuk, the ally of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, tweeted just two weeks ago. Local Ukrainian staff at the US embassy in Kyiv say they feel abandoned by the American government with no support or means of escape as the Russian military continues its invasion of Ukraine, Foreign Policy reports. In a letter sent to US state department officials, the locally employed staff pleaded for help, including evacuation from fighting zones, relocation, US visas, and clear lines of communication with the state department in Washington, as fighting intensifies across Ukraine. The letter reads: We have worked side by side with you for two decades, and always had strong faith in the work US government was doing. We need your help now. This is not a time to wait and research. This is time to act. Your actions can save our lives. FP writes that the letter mirrors concerns from thousands of local employees who worked for the US government in Afghanistan and were later abandoned as Taliban forces gained control of the country late last year. Before, we were told, that Ukraine is not Afghanistan. We donâ€™t want it to be, but if the difference is in size of bombs flying over our heads, it is not fair. Ukraineâ€™s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted a video of himself outside the presidential administration in Kyiv to dispel rumours that he has fled the capital. Wearing olive green military-style clothing and standing with his prime minister, chief of staff and other senior aides, Zelenskiy vowed stay and defend the capital against the Russian invasion. He said: Weâ€™re all here. Our military is here. Citizens in society are here. Weâ€™re all here defending our independence, our country, and it will stay this way. Russiaâ€™s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, has warned both Finland and Sweden that they will face â€œdetrimental military and political consequencesâ€<9d> if they attempt to join Nato. Zakharova was speaking at a press conference in Moscow earlier this afternoon, where she warned that the Nato accession of either Finland or Sweden would spark a serious response from Moscow. We regard the Finnish governmentâ€™s commitment to a military non-alignment policy as an important factor in ensuring security and stability in northern Europe. There are reports of a large fire and explosion in Kharkiv, Ukraineâ€™s second largest city. Note: events are moving fast and the above footage has not been independently verified. In the latest alarming development, a senior US defence source has briefed Pentagon reporters that they believed Russia has launched an amphibious landing with thousands of naval infantry to the west of the key southern coastal city of Mariupol, the Guardianâ€™s Peter Beaumont reports. While the claim had few details, video posted on social media earlier appeared to show a column of Russian armoured vehicles, including T-72B3 tanks and BMP-3 armoured vehicles, moving through the coastal town of Prymorsk which is located between Melitopol and Mauripol. Describing the â€œamphibious assaultâ€<9d> under way from the Sea of Azov a senior US defence official told reporters on Friday that Russians â€œputting potentially thousands of naval infantry ashore there.â€<9d> He added: The general assumption is they are going to move towards the north-east, towards Mariupol and the Donbas region. Several social media accounts in the region also show images and accounts of volleys of Russian Grad missiles hitting targets near Mariupol late on Friday afternoon. If the account of the landing is confirmed as true, the aim would appear to be to allow Russian marines to link up with forces further east in the Donbas region. More than 50,000 Ukrainians have fled the country in the past 48 hours, according to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi. He said the majority of those who have fled have gone to Poland and Moldova. Russia will â€œpartly limitâ€<9d> access to Facebook, Russiaâ€™s censorship agency has announced. Russiaâ€™s communications regulator Roskomnadzor said the move was in response to restrictions Facebook has imposed on Russian media, accusing it of â€œcensorshipâ€<9d>. It was not immediately clear what the restrictions would involve. Russia has been banned from entering the Eurovision Song Contest, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said. A statement from the body, which produces the competition, said the decision â€œreflects concern that, in light of the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine, the inclusion of a Russian entry in this yearâ€™s Contest would bring the competition into disreputeâ€<9d>. Greeceâ€™s foreign ministry has said it is taking the emergency step of closing its embassy in Kyiv, our Greece correspondent Helena Smith writes. In an urgent statement it said it had instructed the entire diplomatic mission to be dismantled with immediate effect because of the radically deteriorating security situation in the Ukrainian capital. Staff, including the Greek ambassador, would be leaving the country by car, it said. With a large ethnic Greek community in Ukraine, Athens in contrast to other EU capitals has been reluctant to close any of its diplomatic representations in the crisis-torn nation. Missions in the east have instead been reinforced. The ministry said Greeceâ€™s general consulates in Mariupol - the frontline city that is home to a 120,000 strong Greek diaspora - and Odessa would remain open. Plans are also afoot to evacuate ethnic Greeks via Rumania and Bulgaria if need be, diplomats say. Within minutes of the first explosions, Ukraineâ€™s great exodus began, our correspondent Luke Harding writes. Some had been planning for a Russian invasion for months. They had carefully filled the car with petrol, bought food supplies, and packed a getaway bag, just in case. And, in many cases, a carrier for much loved family pets. Others had done nothing whatsoever. Until Russiaâ€™s blitzkrieg invasion began early on Thursday, many people in Kyiv believed the prospect fanciful. And yet the nightmare was real enough: air raid sirens, Russian helicopters flying low against a grey sky in attack formation, the roar of enemy war planes. By Friday, as Russian forces approached Kyiv from the north-west, Ukraine responded in two ways. One was by fighting. Its protagonists were soldiers, military veterans, volunteers. Ukrainian servicemen tried to hold back a powerful enemy advancing on multiple fronts: from the east and Russia; the south and Crimea; the north and Belarus. The other, bigger group were civilians fleeing the surging conflict. They left by any means possible. This meant cars â€“ a great, wheeled caravan which filled the road west out of the city, and continued for dozens of miles. For hours this procession scarcely moved. Drivers emerged to stretch their legs. It was unprecedented, Ukraineâ€™s biggest ever jam. Those without vehicles had to find other options. There were long queues at Kyiv-Pasazhyrsky railway station. Some trains were cancelled but a few, remarkably, were running, albeit delayed by five or six hours. Military transport took priority, railway staff explained. Buying a ticket was almost impossible in a panicked city of three million people. Some set off on foot, walking along the verge of the E40 road in the early hours of Friday morning, pulling carry-on cases. One departed on a mountain bike. On the day of invasion the Ukrainian government introduced a 10pm-7am curfew. Trains on the Soviet-built Kyiv metro stopped promptly. The underground stations remained open all night, now serving as bomb shelters. We left at 5.30am when we heard the first explosions Vera Ivanovna said, wiping away tears. She said she had been driving for 28 hours, after setting off from her home in Sumy, in north-eastern Ukraine, close to the city of Kharkiv and the Russian border. I didnâ€™t bring any clothes. I took my mother, nine-year-old daughter, and sister. The Council of Europe has suspended Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, AFP reports. The 47-nation council announced that Russia was suspended with â€œimmediate effectâ€<9d> from the organisationâ€™s Committee of Ministers and parliamentary assembly on Friday â€œas a result of the Russian Federationâ€™s armed attack on Ukraine.â€<9d> If youâ€™ve just joined us, here are the key events from today so far: Fighting has reached the suburbs and historic centre of Kyiv after a night of Russian missile attacks on the Ukrainian capital. Russian forces advanced to the outskirts of the city from three sides while Ukrainian soldiers established defensive positions at key bridges and patrolled in armoured vehicles down the cityâ€™s streets. Russiaâ€™s defence ministry claimed its forces had cut Kyiv off from the west and seized the strategic Hostomel airfield to the north-west, on the cityâ€™s outskirts, allowing it to airlift troops to the front. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said the city had entered â€œa defensive phaseâ€<9d>. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia was ready to send a delegation, including foreign and defence ministry officials, to the Belarusian capital, Minsk, for talks with Ukraine, providing the country agreed to demilitarise. Ukraineâ€™s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier in the day urged Russia to start negotiations, although it is unclear under which terms he would be ready to talk. President Zelenskiy, pleaded for international help and for western powers to act faster to cut off Russiaâ€™s economy and provide Ukraine with military assistance. â€œWhen bombs fall on Kyiv, it happens in Europe, not just in Ukraine,â€<9d> he said. â€œWhen missiles kill our people, they kill all Europeans.â€<9d> The west scrambled to respond to Vladimir Putinâ€™s aggression with a range of fresh sanctions against Moscow, with the US also announcing it would send a further 7,000 troops to Germany to shore up Natoâ€™s eastern borders. There were divisions, however, on the strength of the response. EU foreign ministers announced they will seek to freeze the foreign-held assets of Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, under a new sanctions package due to be finalised on Friday. The move is largely symbolic and does not include a travel ban, as ministers wish to maintain a diplomatic way through the crisis. But the EU is holding back from blocking Russia from an international payments system through which it receives foreign currency or from personally targeting Putin with sanctions. The UK has said it will work â€œall dayâ€<9d> to persuade fellow European states to cut Russia off from the international Swift payment system. The Council of Europe has launched a process to suspend Russiaâ€™s membership, Polandâ€™s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki said. A member of the 47-nation human rights body since 1996, Russia was kicked out of the Council of Europeâ€™s parliamentary assembly over the annexation of Crimea in 2014, but reinstated in 2019 with full rights. Formula One has cancelled the Russian Grand Prix after a meeting between F1â€™s CEO Stefano Domenicali, team principals and the FIA, concluded with the clear, widespread opinion that the sport could not go to Russia while it engaged in an invasion of Ukraine. All 13 Ukrainian soldiers defending an island in the Black Sea from an air and sea bombardment died after refusing to surrender to Russian troops on Thursday, Ukrainian officials said. Vladimir Putinâ€™s extraordinary appeal to Ukraineâ€™s army to overthrow the countryâ€™s democratic government is the first time the Russian president has openly spoken about regime change in Kyiv, writes the Guardianâ€™s Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth. In the video, Putin claimed that Ukrainian fighters were firing rocket artillery from large cities like Kyiv in order to provoke a Russian response and civilian casualties. He did not provide any evidence for that claim. He also praised the activities of the Russian military, who he said were bravely protecting â€œour people and our fatherland.â€<9d> Military analysts have suggested that regime change is a goal of the campaign, based on the scale of the Russian invasion and the Kremlinâ€™s political goals. But by calling for soldiers to overthrow Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Putin may be looking for a political pretext to explain what US intelligence have said may be the plan in Ukraine: to overthrow Ukraineâ€™s president and replace him with a puppet leader Barely 24 hours before Russia launched all-out war on its neighbour, Chinese pundits had predicted that conflict in Ukraine was not inevitable. Now Beijing finds itself walking a tightrope, writes the Guardianâ€™s China Affairs correspondent Vincent Ni. On Thursday, as she refused to use the word â€œinvasionâ€<9d> to describe Russiaâ€™s action, the foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, also indicated that China would not provide arms to Russia. â€œI believe that as a strong country, Russia doesnâ€™t need China or other countries to provide weapons to it,â€<9d> she said. Bonny Lin, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC, said â€œBesides Chinaâ€™s effort to balance its various goals, all indications point to the fact that China prioritises its relationship with Russia at the moment,â€<9d> adding that Moscowâ€™s action also posed a problem for Beijing. In public, Beijing advocates the position that sovereignty is sacrosanct. This is a discourse it often deploys when it talks about Taiwan, which it regards as a breakaway province. On the other hand, the Ukraine crisis offers Beijing the opportunity to express grievances against its common adversaries with Russia: the US and Nato. So far, the latter appears to be weighing heavier in Beijingâ€™s messaging. Read Vincentâ€™s piece here: China ponders how Russiaâ€™s actions in Ukraine could reshape world order Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the exiled Russian businessman and Putin opponent, has said he believes the Russian President is â€œcapable of anythingâ€<9d>, even, he said potentially â€œpressing the red buttonâ€<9d> to launch a nuclear war, the Guardianâ€™s Kate Connolly reports. He said if he was not stopped Putin could set his sights on threatening other countries, citing the corridor between Lithuania and the Russian province Kaliningrad as a likely next target. The most important contribution the west could make to help bring the Russian invasion of Ukraine to an end was to show unity against Putinâ€™s aggression and provide training, weaponry and voluntary fighters to Ukraine. Media on the ground in Ukraine and Russia also had a vital role to play. But he said he feared that a weak leadership in the west made Putin â€œfeel safeâ€<9d> and would be exploited by him. If more was not done to help Ukraine he would feel emboldened to go further, he said. Speaking from the London office of his pro-democracy NGO, The Dossier Centre, on Friday via Zoom with European journalists, Khodorkovsky, who spent ten years in a Russian prison on fraud and embezzlement charges that were widely believed to have been politically motivated, said sanctions against Russia were important â€œfrom an ethical viewpointâ€<9d> but otherwise largely tokenistic. Whilst they might have an impact in the medium term, they would take around three years to properly kick in and Putin would have â€œtaken all of that into accountâ€<9d> before launching his attack, he said. The world was such a global village an oligarch could easily offset the effect of many of the sanctions, he said. They can do their shopping in Dubai rather than in Milan. They can get supplies of microprocessors from China instead of from the United States and so on. Asked if there was evidence that Putin was suffering from an illness, or was simply playing on the â€œcrazy man strategyâ€<9d>, Khodorkovsky responded: â€œHe has found himself in an information bubble which forms a very distorted picture of the world in his eyes.... what does that mean for the rest of us? It means heâ€™s very dangerous. Does it mean that heâ€™s capable of pressing the red button? The nuclear button? I hope that he hasnâ€™t gone that far yet in his understanding of the world, but one could never be confident about this.â€<9d> Khodorkovsky said that it was time for Britain to decide whether it should continue to tolerate the extent to which Russian influence and investment in Britain, in everything from business and banking to sport and the arts, played an integral part in British life. I would be very intolerant and uncompromising of that part of Putinâ€™s establishment who use the UK... to try to influence the political system of the UK... Is it acceptable, ethically and morally? British society has to decide that for itself. He said he was particularly disturbed at the extent to which â€œthe Kremlin uses US and British legal companies in order to reduce the impact of the sanctions on it by lobbying its interests and bribing representatives of both US and British societies.â€<9d> He said he might choose to share specific examples at a later date. Khodorkovsky said that opposition to Russia was in a far worse state than when he was behind bars as a Putin opponent in 2003, citing the case of the imprisoned opposition activist Alexei Navalny. â€œI was at least tried in the Moscow City Court, whilst Navalny is being tried in his penal colony.â€<9d> Referring to his military attack on Ukraine, Khodorkovsky said he believed the biggest challenge facing Putin would be the â€œpsychological taskâ€<9d> of keeping the army on board because Ukrainians had long formed a significant part of the Soviet forces up to the highest ranks and many would therefore question what they were doing attacking Ukraine or would face the questioning and doubts of their families.. He fought back tears as he described being overwhelmed as he had watched the invasion unfold. It is just impossible, unimaginable. Except the day before it was impossible and today itâ€™s reality. Russian forces have renewed their assault on the eastern city of Kharkiv hitting it with air strikes and shelling, the Guardianâ€™s Peter Beaumont reports. Residents in the city close to the Russian border had earlier reported air raid sirens and the sounds of bombers over head. Now Roland Oliphant of the Telegraph, who has been reporting from around Kharkiv, is tweeting that it sounds as if a multiple launch rocket system is hitting the city. Russian President Vladimir Putin has urged the Ukrainian army to overthrow its leadership whom he labelled as a â€œgang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who have has lodged itself in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people.â€<9d> Addressing the Ukrainian military in a televised address, a visibly angry Putin urged the military to â€œtake power in your own handsâ€<9d>. It seems like it will be easier for us to agree with you than this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis. Putin further repeated his claim that the Ukrainian leadership had been engaged in â€œgenocideâ€<9d> in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. We are fighting with nationalist groups that are directly responsible for the genocide of the Donbas and the bloodshed of peaceful civilians in the two republics. In the address, Putin further accused the Ukrainian â€œneo-Naziâ€<9d> leadership of acting like terrorists, by â€˜cowering behind civiliansâ€™. The Council of Europe has launched a process to suspend Russiaâ€™s membership, Polandâ€™s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said, Reuters reports. Russia has been a member of the 47-nation human rights body since 1996. It was kicked out of the Council of Europeâ€™s parliamentary assembly over the annexation of Crimea in 2014, but reinstated in 2019 with full rights. Ukraineâ€™s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has urged the US to use its influence on â€œhesitant European countriesâ€<9d> that oppose banning Russia from the Swift payments system. Kuleba did not name those â€œhesitantâ€<9d> countries, but we know they include France, Germany and Italy. Earlier, Ukraineâ€™s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy was withering about Italyâ€™s prime minister Mario Draghi, in a tweet about apparent attempts to set up a phone call. Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister Sergey Lavrov are expected to be put on an EU list of individuals facing asset freezes, the blocâ€™s high representative for foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, has confirmed. Speaking ahead of a meeting of EU foreign affairs ministers, where a second tranche of sanctions against Russia will be approved, Borrell said: If there are no surprises and no one objects as we require unanimity then, yes, Putin and Lavrov will be on the list. As the Guardianâ€™s Daniel Boffey reports, the move is largely symbolic, as the Russian president is unlikely to have identifiable personal assets abroad, but it will be part of an attempt to highlight the EUâ€™s resolve. â€œI think we agree that Putin and Lavrov, as far as the freezing of assets is concerned, that we will find a consensus here,â€<9d> said Luxembourgâ€™s foreign minister, Jean Asselborn. Putin and Lavrov, who has been foreign minister since 2004, would not face travel bans as the EU wishes to maintain a diplomatic way through the crisis, ministers said. The hacker group Anonymous has said it is â€œofficially in cyber war against the Russian governmentâ€<9d> reports the Guardianâ€™s global technology editor Dan Milmo. The statement in a tweet thread came as several Russian government websites such as the Kremlin and the Duma, as well as the state-backed RT news site (formerly Russia Today), were hit by so-called distributed denial of service attacks. Anonymous, whose targets in the past have included the CIA and IS, added in another tweet that private sector entities would be affected too. In a DDoS, a website is deluged with spurious requests for information â€“ akin to stuffing a thousand envelopes through a letterbox every second â€“ that render the site unreachable. According to Craig Terron, a senior analyst at Recorded Future, which monitors cyber-threats, the RT site remained â€œintermittently availableâ€<9d> today, having gone down at 5pm (2pm GMT) Moscow time on Thursday. The website is intermittently available, with continued reports of users unable to access the website, as of 1330 Moscow time on 25 February. RT said it had been â€œable to repelâ€<9d> the hit on its servers. Ukrainian officials have said that higher than usual radiation levels have been detected in the area near the old Chernobyl nuclear plant, scene of the worldâ€™s worst nuclear disaster. After Russia said it had taken control of the plant, Ukraineâ€™s State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate reported on Friday higher gamma radiation levels had been detected in the Chernobyl zone. It said the levels were â€œnot criticalâ€<9d>, but didnâ€™t provide details of the increase, Associated Press and Reuters reported. The inspectorate attributed the rise to a â€œdisturbance of the topsoil due to the movement of a large amount of heavy military equipment through the exclusion zone and the release of contaminated radioactive dust into the airâ€<9d>. Nuclear experts said on Friday that radiation levels had risen at the Chernobyl plant, based on automated monitoring data, but cast doubt about attributing that to disturbed soil, reports the Guardianâ€™s science correspondent Hannah Devlin. Prof Tom Scott, a nuclear expert at Bristol University, who was in touch with the Ukrainian team responsible for managing Chernobyl earlier this week, said: Radiation levels have gone up, which in normal times would be very unusual, but not to levels where Iâ€™d be really concerned or panic. Scott said reports of the spike being caused by disturbed radioactive topsoil did not entirely fit with automated monitoring data he had seen, which showed highest levels of radioactivity immediately around the power plant, which doesnâ€™t have any soil. The most toxic nuclear waste is encased in a concrete sarcophagus inside Reactor No 4, covered by a large metal arch-shaped structure. Scott said that the metal exterior could be damaged by artillery fire, but that â€œit would take something deliberate and substantialâ€<9d> to damage the internal concrete sarcophagus and cause a major radioactive leak. Moldovaâ€™s national naval agency has said a ship in â€œneutral watersâ€<9d> of the Black Sea has been hit by a missile, leaving two crew members seriously injured, Associated Press reports. The Naval Agency said in a statement that the source of the missile that hit the Moldova-flagged Millennial Spirit on Friday was unknown. A fire broke out onboard the ship; the equipment and lifeboats were destroyed. The shipâ€™s crew left the ship equipped only with life jackets. The agency said that the company that operates the tanker is a Ukrainian legal entity and the crew members are Russian citizens. Rescue operations were carried out by Ukrainian authorities, the Moldovan agency said. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney has hit back, after Russia cited Ireland as part of an attempted justification for invading Ukraine. Russiaâ€™s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov referred to Ireland and the status of the English language, as he accused the west of double standards over Ukraine. The response from Dublin was swift: While most global powers have been roundly damning of Vladimir Putinâ€™s actions in Ukraine, Indiaâ€™s response has been somewhat muted â€“ a reflection of the diplomatic dilemma that the country now finds itself in: torn between Russia and the west. As the Guardianâ€™s south Asia correspondent Hannah Ellis-Petersen writes, hours after Putinâ€™s invasion began, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, was among the first to call the Russian president, calling for a â€œcessationâ€<9d> of violence, but steering clear of directly condemning his actions. Indiaâ€™s top diplomat at the UN was equally evasive, expressing â€œregretâ€<9d> at the invasion, and calling for â€œurgent de-escalation of tensionsâ€<9d>. India currently relies on Russia for around 60%-70% of their arms and military hardware, which are crucial at a time when they are engaged in a frosty stand-off with China along their border. India recently purchased a missile defence system from Russia and relies on it for essential spare parts for defence machinery. Putin made a visit to India as recently as December 2021, one of the only countries the Russian President has travelled to during the pandemic, a sign of the close ties between the two countries. India also relies on Russia for vital supplies of fertiliser, and the severe sanctions on Russia could severely impact Indian farming and industry. On Friday, the Russian chargÃ© dâ€™affaires in Delhi, Roman Babushkin, said that they â€œexpect our Indian partners to support Russiaâ€<9d> at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) when a resolution opposing the military Russian operation against Ukraine will come up for a vote. India is expected to abstain. Indiaâ€™s relatively neutral position is likely to anger the US, another ally of the Indian government. In a call to the Indian foreign minister S Jaishankar on Thursday, US secretary of state Antony Blinken urged a â€œstrong collective responseâ€<9d>. But the request was met with derision by a ministry of information spokesperson, Kanchan Gupta, who in a mocking tweet questioned why India should back the US position when they had taken â€œconsistently anti-India positions at the UN...yet you want Indiaâ€™s helpâ€<9d>. The Ukrainian ambassador to India, Igor Polikha, pleaded with Modi to use his influence with Russia to restrain Putinâ€™s actions, calling it a â€œmoment of destinyâ€<9d>. Talking to India media, Polikha said: I donâ€™t know how many world leaders Putin may listen to, but the stature of Modi makes me hopeful. We are waiting, asking, pleading for the assistance of India. Russia is ready to send diplomats to Minsk for talks with Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. According to the Interfax news agency, Peskov said Vladimir Putin was ready to send officials from the Kremlin, defence and foreign affairs ministries for talks in the Belarusian capital to discuss â€œthe neutral status of Ukraineâ€<9d>, adding that Ukraineâ€™s â€œdemilitarisation and denazificationâ€<9d> were an essential part of this neutral status. Ukraineâ€™s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier in the day urged Russia to start negotiations, although it is unclear under which terms he would be ready to talk. Putinâ€™s entirely unfounded claim that Ukraine is under Nazi rule is a key part of the Kremlinâ€™s justification for war. As Russia has just sent a massive invading army into Ukraine, the latest announcement is been treated with scepticism by Moscow reporters. The Kremlin statement came not long after foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia was only prepared to talk once Ukrainians â€œput down their armsâ€<9d>, suggesting, perhaps, some confusion over the Russian governmentâ€™s intentions. From an Associated Press reporter in the north of Kyiv: Kyiv â€œhas entered into a defensive phaseâ€<9d>, its mayor, Vitali Klitschko, has said, as Russian forces closed in on Ukraineâ€™s capital. Speaking to journalists, he said: The city has gone into a defensive phase. Shots and explosions are ringing out in some neighbourhoods. Saboteurs have already entered Kyiv. The enemy wants to put the capital on its knees and destroy us. Quote from Reuters. Russiaâ€™s military has said it has blocked Kyiv from the western side and captured the strategic Hostomel airport outside the capital, news agency Interfax reports. Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov also said more than 200 people from Ukrainian special units had been killed. The Russian claims have not been independently verified. As Associated Press reports, the airport has a long runway allowing the landing of heavy-lift transport planes, which means Russia could airlift troops directly to Kyivâ€™s outskirts. Hostomel is just 7 km (4 miles) northwest of the city. Ukrainian military vehicles were reported to be entering Kyiv to defend the capital, according to TV news cited by Reuters. The EU is preparing to freeze the assets of Russiaâ€™s president Vladimir Putin and foreign minister Sergei Lavrov as part of a third round of sanctions against Russia, the Financial Times reports. Foreign ministers are planning to approve the sanctions package this afternoon, along with a number of measures against Russian banks and industry, the paper quotes three people familiar with the matter. Putin and Lavrov will not be subject to a ban on travelling under the measures, the FT writes, underlining the EUâ€™s willingness to keep symbolic diplomatic possibilities open. An EU official, speaking under condition of anonymity, told Reuters: â€œWe are moving as quickly as we can,â€<9d> adding the bloc could also target â€œmany moreâ€<9d> oligarchs. Russian forces have taken control of Hostomel airfield near Kyiv and landed paratroopers in the area, Russiaâ€™s Interfax news agency is reporting. Russiaâ€™s defence ministry said the Russian military â€œeliminatedâ€<9d> more than 200 people from Ukraineâ€™s special units during the capture of the strategic aerodrome. It said forces had blocked access to Kyiv from the west, and separatist forces in eastern Ukraine had attacked Ukrainian army positions with Russian army support. Kyiv has entered into â€œa defensive phaseâ€<9d>, the mayor of the Ukrainian capital, Vitali Klitschko, says. Speaking at a news briefing, Klitschko said: The city has gone into a defensive phase. Shots and explosions are ringing out in some neighbourhoods. Saboteurs have already entered Kyiv. The enemy wants to put the capital on its knees and destroy us. The Russian news agency Tass reports that the Russian defence ministry says forces will not strike residential areas of Kyiv. Formula One has cancelled the Russian Grand Prix after the stateâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, the Guardianâ€™s Giles Richards reports. The sport did not issue any condemnation of Russia but cited the â€œimpossibilityâ€<9d> of holding the race under the current circumstances. The meeting, set to take place in September, is expected to be provisionally replaced on the calendar by Turkey, with the Istanbul Park circuit already on standby as a replacement for potential Covid-related cancellations. On Thursday evening F1â€™s CEO Stefano Domenicali held a meeting with the team principals and the FIA to discuss the Russian GP, with clear, widespread opinion that the sport could not go to Russia while it engaged in an invasion of Ukraine. Red Bullâ€™s team principal Christian Horner had described the idea of going to Russia as simply untenable and the world champion Max Verstappen had decried the idea of going racing in a country that had declared war on a neighbouring state. Aston Martinâ€™s Sebastian Vettel was the first driver to declare he would boycott the race if it went ahead. A statement from F1 read: the FIA Formula 1 World Championship visits countries all over the world with a positive vision to unite people, bringing nations together. We are watching the developments in Ukraine with sadness and shock and hope for a swift and peaceful resolution to the present situation. On Thursday evening Formula One, the FIA, and the teams discussed the position of our sport, and the conclusion is, including the view of all relevant stakeholders, that it is impossible to hold the Russian Grand Prix in the current circumstances. Chinaâ€™s president, Xi Jinping, told Vladimir Putin that China supports Russia in efforts to resolve the Ukraine crisis via dialogue, Chinese state media is reporting. In a readout of the call on state broadcaster CCTV, Xi pointed out that the â€œsituation in eastern Ukraine has undergone rapid changes... (and) China supports Russia and Ukraine to resolve the issue through negotiationâ€<9d>. According to the Chinese media readout, Putin outlined the reasons for Russia launching the â€œspecial military operationâ€<9d>, and told Xi that Nato and the United States had â€œlong ignored Russiaâ€™s reasonable security concernsâ€<9d>. He also told Xi on the call that Russia was ready to hold â€œhigh-levelâ€<9d> talks with Ukraine. According to the CCTV readout, Xi said China was â€œwilling to work with all parties in the international community to advocate a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept, and firmly safeguard the international system with the United Nations at the coreâ€<9d>. Hereâ€™s more on Ukraineâ€™s president Volodymyr Zelenskiyâ€™s recent comments as he called on Vladimir Putin to sit return to the negotiation table. In a televised statement today, Zelenskiy said he is calling on the Russian leader to negotiate to put an end to the fighting. I would like to address the president of Russia once again: fighting is happening all over Ukraine, letâ€™s sit down for talks to stop deaths. The Ukrainian leader urged Europe to act more quickly and forcefully in imposing sanctions on Moscow for invading Ukraine, accusing western allies of politicking as Moscowâ€™s forces advanced on Kyiv. â€œEurope has enough strength to stop this aggression,â€<9d> Zelenskiy said, adding that everything from banning Russians from entering the European Union to cutting Moscow off from Swift to an oil embargo should be on the table. You still can stop this aggression. You have to act swiftly. According to a leaked draft of the new sanctions agreed by EU leaders, all members of the Duma, the Russian security council and any Belarusian officials in the military and ministry of defence who â€œfacilitatedâ€<9d> the invasion of Ukraine will be subject to travel bans and asset freezes, the Guardianâ€™s Daniel Boffey reports. The previous sanctions hit the 351 Duma members who had supported recognition by Russia of the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. There is a proposal to enlarge the listing criteria for sanctioning individuals as well to â€œbetter capture other forms of support to the regime, including oligarchsâ€<9d>. Two additional banks will be subject to sanctions: Alfa bank and Otkritie, and there will be a prohibition on EU financial service providers lending to eight companies, ranging from the owners of seaports to automobile manufacturers. There is also a proposal to prohibit new deposits of over â‚¬100,000 in EU banks by Russian nationals. Foreign ministers will meet later this afternoon to approve the draft text. â€œThose pictures, that footage that everybody saw, thatâ€™s literally my home... Thanks god my family is safe.â€<9d> This was the moment on a live broadcast when a BBC journalist from Ukraine saw footage of her family home, partially destroyed overnight in Kyiv. Afghanistanâ€™s Taliban have said they are â€œconcernedâ€<9d> about the possibility of civilian casualties in Ukraine, reports the Guardianâ€™s Akhtar Makoii The Taliban foreign ministry said in a statement they will remain neutral in line with their foreign policy. The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan calls for restraint by both parties. All sides need to desist from taking positions that could intensify violence. We are closely monitoring the situation in Ukraine and express concerns about the real possibility of civilian casualties. Afghanistanâ€™s new rulers, who have not been recognised by any country, have asked Ukraine and Russia to resolve the problem through â€œdialogue and peaceful means.â€<9d> The statement called on parties to pay attention to safeguarding the lives of Afghan students and migrants in Ukraine. Hundreds of Afghans were evacuated to Ukraine after the country fell to the Taliban last August. Ukraineâ€™s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called on Vladimir Putin to join him at the negotiating table, according to Russian newswire Ria Novosti. Zelenskiy also said Europe can still stop Russiaâ€™s aggression if it acts swiftly. Here are some of his other comments, via Reuters. UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ACCUSES EUROPE OF INSUFFICIENT REACTION, SLOW HELP TO UKRAINE WHILE RUSSIAN UKRAINEâ€™S ZELENSKIY SAYS RUSSIAN ASSAULT LIKE REPEAT OF WORLD WAR TWO UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT TELLS ARMED FORCES â€œYOU ARE ALL WE HAVEâ€<9d> UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT CALLS ON EUROPEAN CITIZENS TO PROTEST TO FORCE THEIR GOVERNMENTS TO MORE DECISIVELY The mayor of Milan has told Valery Gergiev, a conductor close to the Russian president Vladimir Putin, that he will not be allowed to lead an orchestra at the prestigious La Scala opera house in March unless he condemns Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, reports the Guardianâ€™s Angela Giuffrida from Rome. Mayor Giuseppe Sala, who is also president of La Scala, said. We are asking him to take a clear position against this invasion, and in the event he doesnâ€™t do so, we will have to renounce the collaboration. Gergiev, a music director of St Petersburgâ€™s Mariinsky Theatre who was awarded a Hero of Labour of the Russian Federation prize by Putin, is due to return to La Scala on 5 March to finish a programme of Tchaikovskyâ€™s â€˜The Queen of Spadesâ€™. People are too scared to go out, one resident of the Black Sea port city of Odesa, told the Guardianâ€™s Peter Beaumont. Maryna who lives in Odesa who described the situation in the Black Sea port city. I live in Odesa in Kotovsky settlement on the northern edge of the city. There are not many explosions where I am. Itâ€™s a narrow, long town along the coast and Iâ€™m in the north whereas most of the military units are in the south. The only thing near me is a training area which I can usually hear and it is quiet. One of strikes yesterday hit a residential area called 411 Battery. Itâ€™s a historic area named after the gun battery that defended Odessa in World War II but now it is residential. People in Odessa are mainly staying indoors. The shops are open but people are too scared to go out and yesterday people bought all the bread because they were worried it would run out. Asked what she thought Vladimir Putin intended for Ukraine, she answered: It doesnâ€™t matter what I think. I donâ€™t think anyone really knows what will happen. But what I want is for the Ukrainian armed forces to stop the invaders. I am scared and I am unhappy but I hope they can protect us. More reports of gunfire that can be heard in Kyivâ€™s historic city centre. Earlier on Thursday the Guardianâ€™s Emma Graham-Harrison met Kyiv residents in an area of the city that had been hit. A selection of the most powerful images from the conflict this morning. See more in our live gallery here which will be updated through the day. India is exploring ways to set up a rupee payment mechanism for trade with Russia to soften the blow on New Delhi of Western sanctions imposed on Russia. Reuters reports that government and banking sources said Indian officials aere concerned that vital supplies of fertilizer from Russia could be disrupted as sanctions intensify, threatening Indiaâ€™s vast farm sector. India has called for an end to violence in Ukraine but refrained from outright condemnation of Russia, with which it has long-standing political and security ties. Fuel, cash and medical supplies are running low in parts of Ukraine after Russiaâ€™s invasion, which could drive up to five million people to flee abroad, UN aid agencies said. Reuters reports: At least 100,000 people are uprooted in Ukraine after fleeing their homes, while several thousand have already crossed into neighbouring countries including Moldova, Romania and Poland, UN refugee agency spokesperson Shabia Mantoo told a U.N. briefing in Geneva. â€œWe are still trying to see which civilian infrastructure in Ukraine has been hit where,â€<9d> Afshan Khan, Unicefâ€™s regional director for Europe and Central Asia, told the briefing. UN human rights office spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said that it had reports of at least 127 civilian casualties in Ukraine, including 25 killed and 102 injured, â€œcaused by shelling and air strikesâ€<9d>. This was likely a significant under-estimate, she said. Turkey cannot stop Russian warships accessing the Black Sea via its straits, as Ukraine has requested, due to a clause in an international pact that allows vessels to return to their home base, the Turkish foreign minister said. Reuters reports: Ukraine has appealed to Turkey to block Russian warships from passing through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits which lead to the Black Sea, after Moscow on Thursday launched a full-blown assault on Ukraine from land, air and sea. Russian forces landed at Ukraineâ€™s Black and Azov Sea ports as part of the invasion. Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, Turkey has control over the straits and can limit the passage of warships during wartime or if threatened, but the request has put the Nato member in a difficult position as it tries to manage its Western commitments and close ties with Russia. Speaking in Kazakhstan, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey was studying Kyivâ€™s request but said Russia had the right under the Convention to return ships to their home base, in this case the Black Sea. So even if Turkey decided after a legal process to accept Ukraineâ€™s request and close the straits to Russian warships, he said, they would only be prevented from travelling in the other direction, away from their home base into the Mediterranean. The mayor of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv has urged residents to head to subway stations, bomb shelters and basements. Loud blasts were heard in the city earlier, a witness told Reuters, as missile strikes and air raid alerts were reported in a number of cities in Ukraine. There are several lines from the Kremlin coming in on Reuters: Putin will meet the UN Security Council today and hold several international phone calls Russia will impose retaliatory sanctions on western countries Russia recognises Volodymyr Zelenskiy as president of Ukraine Sanctions will cause problems but are solvable since the country has reduced its dependence on foreign imports Russia expects relations with the west to normalise once people understand it was forced to act to protect its security No comment on the duration of the military operations The Kremlin has declined to comment on possible talks between Russiaâ€™s President Vladmir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, but acknowledged the latterâ€™s willingness to discuss a possible neutrality pledge by Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would analyse the offer and added that Moscowâ€™s expectations of Kyiv remained unchanged, Reuters reports. Moscow has long demanded guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or allow the bloc to deploy troops and weapons on its territory. The Ski Association of Japan said on Friday it will pull out its team from a ski cross World Cup event in Russia after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, according to news agency Kyodo. The team also plans to ensure the safety of its athletes and bring them home from Russia, the report said. Japan joins several other nations, including Australia and Canada, in abandoning the event. The authorities in Kyiv have told citizens to stay home to avoid â€œactive military operationsâ€<9d> in the Obolonskyi district, just north of the city centre, Reuters reports. Meanwhile Unicefâ€™s regional director has said the agency is still trying to see which civilian infrastructure has been hit and where. Russian independent news agency Interfax reports Russiaâ€™s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov as saying â€œno one is planning to occupy Ukraineâ€<9d>. He added that Russia still does not recognise the current government in Ukraine as democratic and that president Zelenskiy is lying when he says he is ready to discuss the neutral status of Ukraine. Lavrov said the Russian government wants the Ukrainian people to be independent and that it would ensure the demilitarisation of the country. Separately Reuters reports that Lavrov said Russia is ready for talks once Ukraineâ€™s army stops fighting, and that no one plans to attack the Ukrainian people. â€œWe do not want Neo-Nazis to rule Ukraine,â€<9d> he said. The UN Refugee Agency has predicted that 4 million people may flee Ukraine to other countries â€œif the situation escalates furtherâ€<9d>, Reuters reports. Unicef, which has projected 5 million refugees, said it is strengthening its capacity to help Ukrainian refugees in Moldova, Romania and Poland as a â€œfirst callâ€<9d>, and â€œobviously Hungary and Slovakia as wellâ€<9d>. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights denounced the arrests of some 1,800 anti-war protesters in Russia and called for the release of those unlawfully held for voicing opinions. Virgin Atlantic has announced it will avoid Russian airspace, meaning flights between Britain, India and Pakistan will take between 15 and 60 minutes longer. A spokesperson said: We apologise for any inconvenience caused to customers by slightly longer flight times. The safety and security of our customers and people always comes first and weâ€™re monitoring the situation in Ukraine and Russia extremely carefully following the escalation of conflict, continuing to operate in full compliance with relevant safety regulators, authorities and governments. Russiaâ€™s ministry for the economy said it is working on measures to minimise the impact of the sanctions imposed by western countries following the invasion of Ukraine. The ministry said this will include plans to expand trade and economic ties with Asia, Reuters reports. The ministry said: We understand that the sanctions pressure we have faced since 2014 will now intensify. The rhetoric of some of our foreign colleagues was such that we have been ready for potential new sanctions for a long time. Thousands of people fleeing war in Ukraine are pouring into Poland, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia as Russian missiles pound the capital Kyiv, with many waiting for hours at congested border crossings in freezing temperatures. Reuters reports: A day after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion, it was mostly women and children crossing, after Ukraine restricted passage for men between 18 and 60 years old. Local media in Poland said some had waited 16-18 hours to cross into Medyka in southern Poland in freezing temperatures. Border authorities said 29,000 people had entered Poland from Ukraine on Thursday, though it was unclear how many were war refugees and not foreigners going home. Polandâ€™s deputy interior minister Pawe* Szefernaker said Ukrainian bus drivers were unable to drive across the border as conscription-age men were being held back in Ukraine. Micha* Mielniczuk, a spokesman for the southern Polish region of Podkarpackie said temporary accommodation was being offered to people arriving. â€œThe vast majority continue on to other places throughout Poland after receiving a warm meal,â€<9d> he told the PAP news agency. On the border with northern Romania, women were crying as they bid goodbye to male loved ones, setting off to cross into Sighetu Marmatiei, a Reuters witness said. Long queues had formed as cars waited to board a ferry over the Danube river into Isaccea, a town between Moldova and the Black Sea, local media in Romania showed. Slovak authorities urged people to donate blood and set up hospitals with 5,380 beds assigned for the army or NATO use. Across central Europe, on NATOâ€™s eastern flank, volunteers were putting up messages on social media to organise housing and transport for people arriving from the borders. Activists were setting up food and hot drink distribution points and vets were offering to take care of pets. Bulgaria started issuing passports to its citizens in Kyiv who needed travel documents and had sent four buses to the Ukrainian capital to evacuate people. The city of Sumy in northeaster Ukraine has been taken by Russian forces, a resident told the Guardianâ€™s Peter Beaumont. He has been speaking to people across the country, as the all-out Russian attack continues. Sasha, 33, is a vet who lives in Sumy, the main city in the Sumy region, about 200km west of the Russian border, which was taken yesterday by Russian forces. She said: I live not far from the artillery training school which is where there was fighting yesterday when the Russians came. I have elderly parents and a small child, so we think itâ€™s best to stay. A friend is also with us with her child. We have some food and from what I know from friends who tried to leave people are queuing at borders out of Ukraine and men not being allowed leave. All the traffic in the city has stopped and there is Russian armour in the streets. If the citizens donâ€™t shoot at the Russians, they donâ€™t shoot back. They arrived before lunchtime yesterday which is when we heard the shooting. Itâ€™s quiet now. So far it is only Russian soldiers and they are not making any proclamations. Everything is closed down and people are staying inside. People spent yesterday in cellars and shelters hiding. I canâ€™t see the Russians... but the artillery school is near us, so we heard the fighting. I donâ€™t know what is going to happen and Iâ€™m really scared. I think the Russians want a new Soviet Union and they want us as part of that but no one wants that. Weâ€™ve also heard that the Russians have taken Okhtyrka which is 70 kilometres from here and further west. They have put up the Russian flag. Yulia, aged 33, is a translator for an IT programme who normally lives in the centre of Kyiv but has evacuated to a village on the capitalâ€™s western outskirts. Weâ€™ve been hearing lots of explosions and shelling, mainly in the early morning and late at night. Pretty much, villages around here are now ghost villages. Iâ€™m with my mother in law. We have some supplies but my mother in law is a school director and sheâ€™s been in the bomb shelter with the children with the children since the invasion and thatâ€™s not nice. Weâ€™re close to the outskirts of Kyiv. From what Iâ€™ve heard some Russian troops have got hold of Ukrainian armed forces and uniforms and are trying to enter Kyiv [a reference to President Volodymyr Zelenskiyâ€™s comments about â€œinfiltratorsâ€<9d> and other Ukrainian government statements.] I think itâ€™s safer to stay where we are. A lot of people trying to leave, but there are attacks across the country. Asked what she thought Vladimir Putin wanted she replied: Iâ€™ve been following the Russian social media. I think honestly that their president is a sick person. He wants to restore the USSR. Their people are just following that idea. They are not living in a modern society. They are just following that idea that it is Russia against the US us and the west. Itâ€™s just showing the world. Ukraine is just a war fighting platform. I donâ€™t even think itâ€™s personal.â€<9d> Olena Serdiuk is a 43 year old economist who lives in Dnipro, a city on the river Dnieper just over 200 km from the Black Sea coast. Itâ€™s relatively calm here. Thereâ€™s no shooting and last night there were few people in the streets. There were air strikes on Thursday morning aimed at a radio tower and airfield but I donâ€™t think this city is seen as a valuable target. Iâ€™m scared and stressed. I canâ€™t say I feel physically threatened by invasion but Iâ€™m, worried about the future and the economy. My husbandâ€™s company is in Mariupol. I think I was more [She said she was ] more shocked and shaken by the attack in western regions because no one expected that to happen. While I say I donâ€™t believe the Russians will come into Dnipro maybe thatâ€™s just me protecting myself because I donâ€™t want to believe it. I do hope we can manage fight back and that weâ€™ll get help from other countries, because the Kremlin needs to fall. Gunfire has been heard near the government quarter of Kyiv, Associated Press reports. Franceâ€™s finance minister Bruno Le Maire has said cutting Russia off from the Swift global interbank payments system was â€œa very last resortâ€<9d>, Reuters reports. The European Union and US chose not to cut Russia off from interbank messaging system, as part of toughened sanctions announced on Thursday in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Ahead of a meeting of eurozone finance ministers, Le Maire said: This is the very last resort, Swift, but this is one of the options that remains on the table. His German counterpart, Christian Lindner, said â€œall options are on the tableâ€<9d> in addition to those already agreed. Lithuaniaâ€™s prime minister Ingrida Å imonytÄ— has said the discussion about excluding Russia from Swift is not closed: â€œwe know who disagrees and we continue to negotiate with them.â€<9d> The debate continues to rage, after Ukraineâ€™s government said western allies would have â€œblood on their handsâ€<9d> if they did not cut Russia out of Swift. The head of the Bundestagâ€™s foreign affairs committee, Norbert RÃ¶ttgen, is urging Germany to think again on Swift. Along with France and Italy, Germany favours what more hawkish EU diplomats call an â€œincrementalistâ€<9d> approach to sanctions. A few dozen Ukraine supporters gathered outside Moscowâ€™s de facto diplomatic presence in Taipei, Taiwan on Friday, the Guardianâ€™s Helen Davidson reports from the city. There is a small eastern European community in Taipei, but Taiwanese people have also expressed solidarity with Ukraine as both are self governing democracies threatened by a much larger authoritarian neighbour. Anu Hesselbaek is an Estonian woman who has lived in Taiwan for two years (pictured on the right in red). She told Helen: Itâ€™s so important we stand with Ukraine. If this continues itâ€™s like there will be no end to what superpowers can do. Also I think about what happens next. There is a line of Baltic countries which are very afraid right now. Asked about the parallels between Ukraine and Taiwan, she said: I feel sad. If it can happen in Ukraine, why not here? Estonia and Taiwan have exactly the same area. They could both be afternoon snacks. Russia is restricting the use of its airspace for all British flights, including transit, reports news wire Ria Novosti. The report comes after the UK government announced that Russiaâ€™s national carrier Aeroflot would be banned from British airspace in a sweeping package of sanctions announced on Thursday. As Russian forces advance on Kyiv, Ukraineâ€™s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has been working the phones, urging western countries to toughen up sanctions on Russia and increase military support. Explosions and gunfire have been heard in a northern district of Kyiv, as invading Russian forces closed in, AFP reports from the ground. Pedestrians ran for safety and small arms fire and explosions were heard in the Obolonskyi area. The larger blasts could be heard as far away as the city centre. Russian forces first arrived on the outskirts of Kyiv on Thursday when helicopter-borne troops assaulted an airfield just outside the city, close to Obolonskyi, AFP reports. As they arrived in Obolonskyi within the city, the Ministry of Defenceâ€™s Facebook page urged civilians to resist: We urge citizens to inform us of troop movements, to make Molotov cocktails, and neutralise the enemy. Queues of cars at the borders to leave Ukraine for Hungary and Poland now involve a wait of up to 15 hours, reports the Guardianâ€™s Peter Beaumont in Lviv. However one of the consequences of yesterdayâ€™s general mobilisation order issued by the Ukrainian president, Voldomyr Zelenskiy, is that most men are not allowed to leave, with many dropping their families off at borders. That call-up of reservists has seen men up to the age of 60 summoned for duty. I heard of the case of one 52-year-old and his friends of similar age here in Lviv being called up yesterday to go to help with the defence of Mariupol. Also complicating the issue for those wanting to leave the country is that with internal flights suspended, and fuel in short supply, there is a 20- litre fuel restriction at six petrol stations and inevitable queues. People have been protesting against Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine around the world. Here are some images from demonstrations in Madrid, Sydney and New York. Welcome to rolling updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Iâ€™m Jennifer Rankin and here are the main developments of the past few hours. As dawn broke in Kyiv, air raid sirens were sounding across the Ukrainian capital amid warnings of an imminent Russian attack on the city. Ukraine expects a Russian tank attack later on Friday which could become the hardest day in the war, an adviser to Ukraineâ€™s interior minister said. Anton Herashchenko said the defenders of Kyiv were ready with anti-tank missiles supplied by foreign allies. Earlier, Kyiv residents reported waking to the sound of explosions as reports circulated that Russia had launched a series of missile strikes on the city of just under 3 million people. Many civilians sought safety in bomb shelters and metro stations as reports of Russian tanks were moving closer to the city from all sides. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said it is the view of British intelligence that Russia intends to invade the whole of Ukraine but its army failed to deliver on the first day of its invasion. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said â€œall evidence suggests that Russia intends to encircle and threatenâ€<9d> the Ukrainian capital. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has confirmed multiple reports of Russian missile strikes in a national address early on Friday morning. Multiple explosions were heard in Kyiv on Friday morning as the Russian offensive entered its second day. Two buildings were on fire in the south east of the capital after a Russian plane was shot down and a border post in the south east was hit by a missile, causing casualties. Zelenskiy said 137 people have died and 316 had been wounded so far. In a video address late on Thursday, he lamented that Ukraine had been â€œleft alone to defend our stateâ€<9d>, but said he would stay on in the capital despite being Russiaâ€™s â€œtarget number oneâ€<9d>. Ukraine has decreed a full military mobilisation and all men aged 18-60 have been forbidden from leaving Ukraine. Iâ€™m Samantha Lock and Iâ€™ll be handing over this live blog to my colleagues in London. You can also reach me on Twitter to share your feedback and updates on the unfolding crisis in Ukraine. Ukraineâ€™s deputy minister of defence, Hanna Malyar, said the Russian military seized two cars of the Ukrainian armed forces before changing into the uniform of the Ukrainian military and then driving to the centre of Kyiv from Obolonskyi. Ukrainian lieutenant general Valerii Zaluzhniy appeared to confirm reports in a statement on the website of Ukraineâ€™s armed forces. The charred remains of a residential building in Kyiv has been shared by Ukrainian media today. Early on Friday morning, two residential buildings were seen on fire in south-east Kyiv after they were hit by falling debris from an aircraft that was shot down. The fire comes after reports emerged from a Ukrainian interior ministry official who earlier said Russian aircraft had been shot down in the Darnytskyi district of Kyiv. Myanmar has said it backs Russiaâ€™s attack on Ukraine. Brig. Gen Zaw Min Tun, spokesman for the junta in Myanmar, told The New York Times by telephone: In the case of Russia and Ukraine, Russia has done its part to maintain its sovereignty, and I think it is the right thing to do. Russia is also a big country among world powers and is showing that it also plays a main role in the balance sheet of maintaining world peace.â€<9d> UK defence secretary has said it is the view of British intelligence that Russia intends to invade the whole of Ukraine but its army failed to deliver on the first day of its invasion. Ben Wallace said he estimated Russia has lost more than 450 personnel and the Russian army failed to deliver its major objectives on day one of its invasion. The UKâ€™s ministry of defence earlier released an intelligence update on the developments in Ukraine. Russian forces have likely captured the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Workers have reportedly been detained by Russian troops. The Ukrainian Armed Forces have reportedly halted Russiaâ€™s advance towards Chernihiv. Fighting probably continues on the outskirts of the city. It is unlikely that Russia has achieved its planned day one military objectives. Ukrainian forces have presented fierce resistance across all axes of Russiaâ€™s advance.â€<9d> Overnight, banking officials were also seeking to calm Russians about the effects of sanctions. Russian banks that landed on US, EU and UK sanctions lists have spent the night reassuring depositors that their money is safe, in efforts to maintain calm and prevent bank runs. VTB, Russiaâ€™s second-largest bank, said that the sanctions would not affect the ability of clients to withdraw money at any cash machine in Russia, and that the bank had not restricted foreign currency exchanges. Gazprombank, the countryâ€™s third-largest, assured customers that the sanctions against it were â€œnot blocking (SDN) and do not affect the bankâ€™s regular operations.â€<9d> A Guardian correspondent on Monday observed tellers at Sberbank, Russiaâ€™s largest bank, telling customers they had already exchanged all their reserves of foreign currency and that they would need to come back the next day. Sberbank gave similar assurances to customers, while saying it needed to review the conditions of the new restrictions under the US Treasury sanctions. US banks have until May 25 to finalise their dealings with Sberbank, VTB, Otkritie, Sovcombank, and VEB equities, the body said. Here is a report from the Guardianâ€™s Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth on the Kremlinâ€™s messaging to Russians. Russian lawmakers have been busy trying to justify the countryâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, despite growing evidence of missile and rocket strikes on population centres. Valentina Matviyenko, the chairwoman of Russiaâ€™s Federation Council, said that the government had â€œno other choiceâ€<9d> but to launch an attack that appears to be aimed at capturing major Ukrainian cities like Kyiv. â€œRussia has announced a special military operation to force Ukraine to peace, to stop its militarisation going on in the most active way,â€<9d> she said in public remarks on Friday morning. Matviyenko, who was born in western Ukraine, added: â€œWe were left with no other choice. Yes, it is not an easy choice, but it is the only way to stop the fratricidal war.â€<9d> Vyacheslav Volodin, the chairman of the State Duma, repeated earlier remarks that the massive attack on their country was being carried out in the interests of Ukrainians. â€œUkrainian citizens shouldnâ€™t be afraid of the peacekeeping operation. It is solely aimed at demilitarization,â€<9d> Volodin said during a visit to Nicaragua. He also repeated claims that the operation was aimed at de-Nazification: an indication that if the operation is successful, Russia may seek to carry out reprisals against Ukrainains. â€œUkraine must become a free, independent, democratic and peaceful nation once it is free from the anti-popular regime with a Nazi ideology, and begin developing in the interests of its own citizens,â€<9d> he said. Russian Rosgvardia troops with prisoner vans have been pictured entering Ukraine and US intelligence have warned that Russia has drawn up lists with the names of activists and others who it is planning to target. While that intelligence has not been confirmed, the US has correctly predicted the broader Russian invasion into Ukraine. And Putin has warned that he has planned to punish those guilty of violence against Russians. Photos of devastation across Ukraine have emerged from the nationâ€™s state emergency service. A series of photos uploaded to the agencyâ€™s official Twitter account early on Friday say they show the aftermath of the shelling in Starobilsk, Luhansk, eastern Ukraine. Others show firefighting and rescue teams battling blazes from buildings. Some more powerful words from Ukraineâ€™s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Addressing his country in a national address this morning, he aid: They say that civilian objects are not a target for them. It is a lie, they do not distinguish in which areas to operate.â€<9d> Russian forces that entered Ukraine through Belarus are within kilometres of reaching Kyiv, according to US officials. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin told lawmakers on a phone call that Russian mechanised forces that entered from Belarus were about 20 miles (32km) from Kyiv, according to a person familiar with the call, the Associated Press reports. The call was said to have taken place about 6.30pm ET. The officials described another Russian element that entered Ukraine from Russia being a bit further away, but that both were headed toward Kyiv with the goal of encircling the city and potentially toppling the Ukrainian government, according to the lawmaker on the call. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier said the government had information that â€œsubversive groupsâ€<9d> were encroaching on the city, and US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Kyiv â€œcould well be under siegeâ€<9d>. Ukraineâ€™s president has said his country has been left on its own to fight Russia after the Kremlin launched a large-scale invasion that killed more than 130 Ukrainians in the first day. In a video address to the nation just after midnight, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: We have been left alone to defend our state. Who is ready to fight alongside us? I donâ€™t see anyone. Who is ready to give Ukraine a guarantee of Nato membership? Everyone is afraid. Zelenskiy said that 137 Ukrainians, both military personnel and civilians, had been killed since the start of the attack early Thursday. Another 316 had been wounded, he said. The president added that he and his family remained in Ukraine, despite Russia identifying him as â€œtarget number oneâ€<9d>. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by taking down the head of state. I am staying in the government quarter together with others. The enemy has designated me as the target number one, and my family as the target number twoâ€<9d>. Ukraineâ€™s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has asked eastern European Nato members for defence assistance. Zelenskiy spoke with Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda on Friday to seek defence assistance from eastern European members of Nato and help in bringing Russia to the negotiating table. We need effective international assistance. Discussed this with Andrzej Duda. Appealed to the Bucharest Nine for defence aid, sanctions, pressure on the aggressor. Together we have to put Russia at the negotiating table. We need anti-war coalition.â€<9d> Ukraineâ€™s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba earlier described the attack on Kyiv this morning as â€œhorrificâ€<9d> likening the assault as akin to an attack from Nazi Germany. Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany. Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one. Stop Putin. Isolate Russia. Severe all ties. Kick Russia out of everywhere.â€<9d> Ukraine expects a Russian tank attack on its capital, Kyiv, later on Friday which could become the hardest day in the war, an adviser to Ukraineâ€™s interior minister said. Anton Herashchenko said the defenders of Kyiv were ready with anti-tank missiles supplied by foreign allies. Ukraineâ€™s deputy defence minister also agreed with the assessment that Russian forces may enter areas just outside Kyiv today. The minister added that Ukrainian army units are defending positions on four fronts despite being outnumbered. A Ukrainian military official also said Ukrainian forces managed to repel Russian troops near Chernihiv. This coincides with a report from Ukraineâ€™s defence ministry which earlier said airborne assault troops have blown up a bridge over the Teteriv River at Ivankiv, located about 50km (31 miles) north of Kyiv, in an effort to prevent a Russian column of forces from advancing toward the capital. The ministry said the Russian advance was stopped. The international criminal court says it is following developments in Ukraine with increasing concern, according to a statement seen by Reuters. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan on Friday expressed his concern over the Russian invasion of Ukraine and said his court may investigate possible war crimes in the country. I remind all sides conducting hostilities on the territory of Ukraine that my office may exercise its jurisdiction and investigate any act of genocide, crime against humanity or war crime committed within Ukraine.â€<9d> The ICC prosecutors office will continue to closely monitor situation in Ukraine and may investigate any crime against humanity or war crime committed in Ukraine. Images of damaged buildings, residential towers and even classrooms are beginning to filter in after Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed multiple reports of Russian missile strikes across Ukraine in a national address early on Friday morning. Zelenskiy said the strikes began at 4am local time on Friday, adding that Russian troops were stopped by Ukrainian forces from advancing in most directions. The Guardianâ€™s Peter Beaumont in Ukraineâ€™s western city of Lviv has given his report on the current crisis unfolding around Kyiv. On the second day of Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, it has become increasingly clear what the Kremlinâ€™s military tactics are: which is very quickly to put pressure on the capital Kyiv. Kyiv is facing threats both from its eastern edges, from the west more generally since the capture of the Chernobyl nuclear plant site, and now, according to Ukrainian officials, from the threat of infiltration into the city. While itâ€™s unclear whether the Russian military intends to capture the Ukrainian capital or force itâ€™s capitulation, a combination of missile attacks, a rapid airborne advance using helicopters to the outskirts, and the continuing advance by Russian armour is putting Kyiv in an increasingly difficult position. The latest update from Ukraineâ€™s General Staff claims that the key Hostomel air base, just outside Kyiv is controlled by Kyiv forces again, however heavy fighting is going on north west of the capital. There are also reports that the Ukrainian military has destroyed at least one bridge to slow the Russian advance, although we know that Russian forces have bridge laying companies. This morning, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the government had information that â€œsubversive groupsâ€<9d> were encroaching on the city, while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Kyiv â€œcould well be under siegeâ€<9d> in what U.S. officials believe is a brazen attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to dismantle the government and replace it with his own regime. While Zelinskiy said this morning that Russian troops had been halted in most places but even if that is the case, which seems to contradict his comments on encroachment, the situation is serious. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told lawmakers on a phone call Thursday evening that Russian mechanised forces that entered from Belarus were about 20 miles from Kyiv. While there has been some focus on Russian losses inflicted by Ukrainian defenders â€“ including helicopters, soldiers and armoured vehicles â€“ itâ€™s worth pointing out these are so far at the level the Russian military would have priced in for such a quick and aggressive advance and not evidence necessarily any sign so far that the Russian operation is struggling. We have more from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiyâ€™s national address this morning. Speaking to his citizens in a video address in both Ukrainian and Russian, Zelenskiy continued to make appeals to his neighbour for a ceasefire. Russia will have to talk to us sooner or later about how to end hostilities and stop this invasion. The sooner the conversation begins, the smaller Russiaâ€™s losses will be.â€<9d> Zelenskiy added that world is continuing to observe what is going on in Ukraine from afar while new sanctions have not convinced Russia to withdraw from an attack. This morning we are defending our state alone. Like yesterday, the worldâ€™s most powerful forces are watching from afar. Was Russia convinced by yesterdayâ€™s sanctions? We hear in our sky and see on our earth that this was not enough.â€<9d> He added that until the attacks stop, â€œwe will be defending our country until thenâ€<9d>. We are receiving multiple reports from journalists on the ground in Ukraine that air raid sirens are sounding in Kyiv this morning. Guardian reporter Emma Graham-Harrison is currently in Kyiv and tells us the sirens began sounding about three hours after loud explosions first woke the city around 4.30am. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has confirmed multiple reports of Russian missile strikes in a national address early on Friday morning, Zelenskiy said the strikes began at 4am local time on Friday, adding that Russian troops were stopped by Ukrainian forces from advancing in most directions. The president added that Russian strikes aimed at both military and civilian targets, Reuters reports. Meanwhile, sirens rang out in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv early on Friday, a Reuters witness said. Welcome to rolling updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Iâ€™m Samantha Lock and here are the main developments of the past few hours. As dawn breaks in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, air raid sirens are sounding across the capital. Earlier, residents reported waking to the sound of explosions as reports circulated that Russia had launched a series of missile strikes on the city of just under 3 million. Many civilians sought safety in bomb shelters and metro stations as reports of Russian tanks were moving closer to the city from all sides. Hereâ€™s what we know so far: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has confirmed multiple reports of Russian missile strikes in a national address early on Friday morning. Multiple explosions have been heard in Kyiv on Friday morning as the Russian offensive entered its second day. Two buildings were on fire in the south-east of the capital after a Russian plane was shot down and a border post in the south-east was hit by a missile, causing casualties. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said â€œall evidence suggests that Russia intends to encircle and threatenâ€<9d> the Ukrainian capital. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said 137 people have died and 316 had been wounded so far. In a video address late on Thursday, he lamented that Ukraine had been â€œleft alone to defend our stateâ€<9d>, but said he would stay on in the capital despite being Russiaâ€™s â€œtarget number oneâ€<9d>. The UK said Ukrainian forces had provided â€œfierce resistance across all axes of Russiaâ€™s advanceâ€<9d> and that is was unlikely Russia had achieved all its objectives for the first day of the invasion. Ukraine has decreed a full military mobilisation and all men aged 18-60 have been forbidden from leaving Ukraine. Thousands attempted to flee Kyiv, leading to large traffic queues. Meanwhile, pictures have emerged of Kyiv residents crowding into underground metro stations where they are taking shelter from further Russian attacks. Hundreds of people have been arrested in Russian cities after protests against the invasion. Police have held at least 1,702 people, according to the OVD-Info monitor, with most of the arrests made in Moscow and St Petersburg. Global leaders have decried Russiaâ€™s actions, with many announcing fresh sanctions. US president Joe Biden ordered broad new sanctions, and the UKâ€™s prime minister, Boris Johnson, announced its â€œlargest everâ€<9d> curbs. However, there was concern that the EU was holding back from excluding Russia from the Swift international banking payments system. Officials in western capitals have expressed bewilderment about Vladimir Putinâ€™s mindset and choice in going to war. One described him as â€œdespoticâ€<9d> while Emmanuel Macron said that the Russian leader had been â€œduplicitousâ€<9d> in talks before the invasion.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

There is a definition of the answer and there is some wordplay â€“ a recipe for assembling its letters. In a genuine puzzle environment, of course, you also have the crossing letters, which hugely alleviate your solving load. Also, here, the settersâ€™ names tend to link to profiles of the individuals behind the pseudonyms. When I began solving cryptics, without a series of handy hints like the one youâ€™re reading now, I sometimes wondered: if I take a dictionary and look up what I think is the answer, should I see underneath the part of the clue that I think offers the definition, but perhaps not expect that to work the other way round? I was right, pretty much. Hereâ€™s a recent example from Pasquale in the quiptic, the Guardianâ€™s puzzle â€œfor beginners and those in a hurryâ€<9d>: 11d Bird seen in the museum (3) [ wordplay: some of the letters of (â€œseen inâ€<9d>) THEMUSEUM ] [ definition: bird ] If we look up EMU in Collins Dictionary, we discover â€“ among such extra details as its number of toes â€“ that the EMU is indeed a bird. The entry for â€œbirdâ€<9d>, though, does not single out the EMU. And so when Vulcan clues BIRD, he does it like this: 10a Perhaps hawkâ€™s attempt to catch rook (4) [ wordplay: synonym for â€œattemptâ€<9d> containing (â€œto catchâ€<9d>) chess abbreviation for â€œrookâ€<9d> ] [ BID containing R ] [ definition: perhaps hawk ] By itself, â€œhawkâ€<9d> would not be helpful, because weâ€™re not looking for a hawk; weâ€™re looking for the sort of thing a hawk is. As such, weâ€™re given a â€œperhapsâ€<9d>. This is especially useful when a definition would take the fun out of the exercise. Hereâ€™s Qaos: 12a Perhaps 2000 or 2020 players struggle to control Realâ€™s midfield (4,5) [ wordplay: anagram (â€œstruggleâ€<9d>) of PLAYERS containing middle letters of (â€œmidfieldâ€<9d>) REAL ] [ LEAPYRS containing EA ] [ definition: perhaps 2000 or 2020 ] If Qaos had used, say, â€œperiods of 366 daysâ€<9d>, weâ€™d be writing in LEAP YEARS without any of the pleasure of manipulating PLAYERS and REAL. The setter might also use â€œsayâ€<9d>: 19a Coke and rum originally served in saloon, say (3) [ wordplay: initial letters of (â€œoriginallyâ€<9d>) COKE AND RUM ] [ definition: saloon, say ] Here, Brendan uses â€œsaloonâ€<9d> as an example of a CAR, but new solvers should be aware that â€œsayâ€<9d> in a clue might also indicate EG (more Latin tips here) â€“ and â€œegâ€<9d> in a clue might also mean youâ€™re being given an example of the answer. The quickest way of doing this job is the question mark. Hereâ€™s Vlad with some more birds â€¦ 21a Angry report on Dirty Duck? (8) [ wordplay: synonym for â€œangryâ€<9d> and soundalike of (â€œreport onâ€<9d>) synonym for â€œdirtyâ€<9d> ] [ synonym for â€œangryâ€<9d> and soundalike of â€œfoulâ€<9d> ] [ definition: duck? ] â€¦ this time WILDFOWL. Newspapers have had various rules on this kind of thing down the years and sometimes an example seems to work as a definition without any embellishments; when it does and does not is the kind of thing that some setters and solvers enjoy discussing at great length. For now, though, two final things. Weâ€™ve looked at examples as definitions, but they can also of course be part of the wordplay, as in this from Picaroon â€¦ 10a Checks possibly amber clothing at home (5,2) [ wordplay: what â€œamberâ€<9d> is an example of, containing (â€œclothingâ€<9d>) synonym for â€œat homeâ€<9d> ] [ RESIN containing IN ] [ definition: checks ] â€¦ for REINS IN. Finally, the word â€œsayâ€<9d> in a clue unlocks many more possibilities than the two mentioned above. In the Brendan puzzle cited, every clue ends in â€œ[â€¦], sayâ€<9d> as a masterclass in the ambiguities to which we all willingly and repeatedly subject ourselves. Enjoy.

It is titled Poo Cocktail, and features in quick succession the early stunts, pranks and goofs that make up Jackassâ€™s enduring DNA: the showâ€™s breakout star Johnny Knoxville flies out of a cannon into a net; another of its regulars, Bam Margera, roly-polys down a hill through a group of nonplussed golfers while a cameraman giggles from inside a nearby bush; Ehren McGhehey, the most viscerally headlockable man ever committed to film, intercepts someoneâ€™s drive-thru order and throws it for a touchdown. Jason â€œWee Manâ€<9d> AcuÃ±a, painted orange and dressed as an Oompa Loompa, skates down Venice Beach in a way that astonishes a bystander in wraparound shades. When Jackass first launched on MTV in October 2000, I was 13 and it was the funniest thing I had ever seen. Now Iâ€™m 34 and, well, thereâ€™s a bit in the first episode of Jackass where Knoxville knocks over someoneâ€™s drinking water with a fake erection while politely asking: â€œWhere do you get sodas around here?â€<9d> and itâ€™s still the funniest thing Iâ€™ve ever seen. Its cast of daredevil idiots took vomiting, falling off things, and brief-but-agonising pain and made it into high art. The initial run of Jackass was only three seasons and 25 episodes long, but created an outsized ripple. There were spin-off series, a Knoxville Rolling Stone cover, carnivalesque live tours, and a deluge of scare stories saying middle American teens had suffered harrowing injuries while trying to copy the showâ€™s stunts. Connecticut senator Joe Lieberman wrote to MTVâ€™s parent company Viacom urging it to take greater responsibility regarding its programming to help protect children. By the middle of the third season, red tape and cultural handwringing had taken much of the fun out of pushing a man in a shopping trolley down a hill, and Knoxville announced the series would be the last. Jackass, as a TV show, burned bright, then â€“ infinite MTV repeats aside â€“ faded away. â€œFor the PTSD of filming to subside, it takes three years and eight months,â€<9d> longtime Jackass director Jeff Tremaine says over Zoom, while Knoxville cackles wildly in a browser window beside him. After the conclusion of the TV series, the main cast reunited for the unofficial send-off, 2002â€™s Jackass: The Movie. Then, in 2006, Jackass Number Two. You get the feeling that the entire franchise hangs on whether Knoxville feels like it is a good idea to get hit by a bull this year or not, hence the gap until 2010â€™s Jackass 3D, which really felt like the last instalment. But then, 10 years later, the old itch came back. â€œListen, itâ€™s never not funny to see someone else get hit in the nuts,â€<9d> Tremaine, who is 55, explains. â€œThereâ€™s a certain cultural moment with Jackass, and it went away for a few years, but TikTokâ€™s got a big thing for physical comedy, YouTubeâ€™s all about elaborate pranks. It never goes away.â€<9d> In the late 2010s Knoxville invited Tremaine for lunch. â€œHe dropped about a 200-page document,â€<9d> Tremaine says with a sigh. â€œWe go: â€˜Letâ€™s just shoot for two days and just see if it feels right.â€™ Honestly, five minutes in, we were ready to commit to making a movie.â€<9d> And lo, pandemic delays aside, Jackass Forever â€“ film number four â€“ is ready to drop. Jackass Forever arrives at a time when pandemic restrictions have been ladled on top of the usual health and safety precautions. Cast and crew had to break for seven months while Covid raged. On their return, they were summoned to a room to be talked through the latest safety protocols. Only underneath the table was a hyper-inflatable bouncy castle that promptly exploded. â€œIt was an awkward position because you told us we need to take this seriously, but then you just exploded a bounce house on us,â€<9d> Knoxville tells a giggling Tremaine. â€œTotally mixed messages.â€<9d> Jackass has been swerving inelegantly around health and safety legislation since it began, but there was some arch irony to Covid being a defining safety factor in a film where a baseball gets pitched directly into someoneâ€™s nuts. â€œItâ€™s funny to think about having all these safety protocols to go through just so we could do dangerous shit,â€<9d> Knoxville explains. â€œItâ€™s like, â€˜OK, wear your mask until you get to the alligator pit and take it off and jump in.â€™â€<9d> Knoxville is 50 now, and has allowed his natural grey to show: fellow Jackass lifers have similarly aged on screen (Steve-O, a gravel-voiced trained clown willing to staple any part of himself to anything, looks LA-healthy with perfect beaming veneers; Chris Pontius, the showâ€™s go-to whenever a stunt involved cheerful nudity, is glossy and muscular like an elder but thoroughbred horse). There is a strange sense of mortality to Jackass now: when Steve-O talks of concussions, itâ€™s with the tired experience of someone who has seen too many X-rays of his own head. But while seeing the players age might change the texture of Jackass, the flavour is still the same: thereâ€™s something soothing about knowing that, after 21 years, the core concept hasnâ€™t evolved at all: itâ€™s still just men with high pain tolerance getting hit in the balls and laughing about it. â€œFrom the beginning of time, you see someone walk and fall down, even the cavemen are going to laugh, you know?â€<9d> Knoxville says. Tremaine jumps in: â€œBut thereâ€™s such a genuine bond between all the guys that to me is so funny.â€<9d> One stunt in the latest movie sees the Jackasses taken in pairs into a room they are led to believe has a rattlesnake in it, then the lights go out and we are plunged into night vision. â€œThe funniest thing is listening to them deal with each other in just the most horrific situation,â€<9d> Tremaine laughs. â€œTheyâ€™re like old married couples, yelling at each other. Itâ€™s just so funny how ingrained those relationships are.â€<9d> Anyone could have feasibly got famous by letting a snake attack their penis back in 2001. The appeal of Jackass was that the gang did it while so visibly being friends. Forever sees changes to the original cast. Ryan Dunn died in a car crash in 2011. Margeraâ€™s near-absence (he appears in a single stunt) is due to his firing over substance abuse problems (his subsequent legal case against Paramount further delayed the release of the film). And while celebrity cameos have always been part of the Jackass identity (Brad Pitt appeared in series three), they are even more numerous now: Forever is studded with gleeful extended appearances from stars who grew up laughing manically as teenagers at the show, such as Machine Gun Kelly and Odd Futureâ€™s Jasper Dolphin. They are joined by â€“ gasp! â€“ a woman, in the form of comedian Rachel Wolfson. â€œYeah we just brought her in to meet her and she was so game, and so smart,â€<9d> Knoxville says. â€œHer mother was the judge who put OJ away!â€<9d> Is there anything from Jackassâ€™s past that doesnâ€™t make Tremaine and Knoxville laugh any more? The answer is â€œnot reallyâ€<9d>, which goes some way to explaining its enduringly puerile appeal. â€œNot everything works, but by the time weâ€™re shooting, thereâ€™s almost always something funny about what weâ€™re shooting,â€<9d> Jeff says. â€œThe really gross stuff I donâ€™t find quite so funny any more,â€<9d> Knoxville â€“ a man who once clambered into a week-old portable toilet to secure an MTV pilot â€“ admits wearily. â€œThat said, I think I turned in some ideas for this that were pretty gross.â€<9d> Tremaine butts in with an oddly earnest compliment â€“ â€œYouâ€™ve never been much of a poo poo guyâ€<9d> â€“ and Knoxville blushes in faux humility. â€œAw, shucks: you say the sweetest things, Jeff.â€<9d> So, is this the last time weâ€™ll see Jackass? The term â€œnever say neverâ€<9d> is uttered exactly once every 10 minutes over the course of our conversation. Knoxville did take an incredibly heavy knock from a bull in one of the filmâ€™s crowning stunts (he and Steve-O were fairly significantly hospitalised over the course of filming). â€œI got a really gnarly head injury at the end. So I had to get all kinds of tests; I had to see a neurologist and get all these treatments and whatnot. But I feel like a million lira now.â€<9d> As Tremaine astutely noted, seeing someone else get hit in the balls is always going to be funny. Until it isnâ€™t, you feel, we will always have some form of Jackass. Jackass Forever is released in UK cinemas on 4 February",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

Tarek Namouz, a 42-year-old former pub landlord from London of no fixed address, faces eight charges of entering into a terror funding arrangement on dates between November 2020 and May 2021. He is also accused of two counts of possessing terrorist information relating to videos. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the bounceback loan scheme in May 2020, six weeks into the UKâ€™s first coronavirus lockdown, as part of a series of measures to prop up the UK economy. The scheme was aimed at supporting small British businesses, with Â£47bn paid out in loans from commercial banks guaranteed by the state. On Monday, Namouz appeared at the Old Bailey in London by video link from Wandsworth jail. Jonathan Polnay, prosecuting, said it was alleged that the defendant sent â€œthe proceeds of coronavirus bounceback funding loans to Isisâ€<9d>. Mr Justice Sweeney said it was a â€œserious caseâ€<9d> which would be heard by Judge Peter Lodder, the recorder of Richmond, sitting at Kingston crown court.

You feel Jack Whiteâ€™s pain, his angst â€“ and I love how he hasnâ€™t changed the pronouns. Itâ€™s one of those songs that goes straight through you. Not like diarrhoea! Like a bullet. Best song to have sex to Keep It Up by Milton Wright. Of course it depends on the sort of sex youâ€™re having; thereâ€™s lots of different types: cuddly sex, naughty tie-me-up sex â€“ different strokes for different folks. But I think I could have quite quite a lot of different types of sex to this one one. Plus itâ€™s absolutely one of my favourite tracks in the world, a Desert Island Disc. Desert Island Dick, ha ha! The song Iâ€™d want for my entrance music Whole Lotta Money by BIA and Nicki Minaj â€“ in an ironic way, in some kind of character, preferably in slow motion with a wind machine, please. And some really cool sneakers, so I look like Iâ€™m down with the kids. Just for when Iâ€™m going into Pret to get my sandwich. The song I want played at my funeral Planet Caravan by Black Sabbath feeds my soul â€“ itâ€™s so otherworldly. When you die and move on to another realm, it would be the perfect thing to serenade you. People forget what a legend Ozzy Osbourne was before he was on TV all the time, going on about: â€œThereâ€™s dog mess all over the house.â€<9d> The song I pretend to hate that I secretly like Take My Breath Away by Berlin. I blame Top Gun. I was about five when Top Gun came out and â€“ this sounds wrong â€“ I used to pause it when Iceman came on and snog the telly. My favourite song of all time Right Down the Line by Gerry Rafferty. I actually got a boy back with that song. He was really bad to me, I told him to go away, I didnâ€™t speak to him for months then sent him that track â€“ and he cried. He was over in two shakes of a lambâ€™s tail. He can bugger off now, but me and one of my best friends play it all the time. My favourite song right now Dreamflower by Tarika Blue, a funky fusion band from the 1970s. Itâ€™s so dreamy and blissed out â€“ listen to it mid-bottle of wine or a spliff or whatever youâ€™ve got to hand and just chill.

The first of the long-awaited novels is due out in October, allowing plenty of time to catch up or re-familiarise yourself with the great US authorâ€™s back catalogue. Booker-shortlisted novelist Chigozie Obioma, who has been a fan of McCarthyâ€™s since picking up a copy of The Road from a friendâ€™s shelf in 2010, suggests some good ways to start. *** The entry point The work of an eccentric writer such as McCarthy is best approached by reading the book that comes closest to being mainstream: All the Pretty Horses. The first of the Border Trilogy, it won McCarthy a national book award in 1992 and has been adapted into a popular film starring Matt Damon and PenÃ©lope Cruz. Set in the American south-west, it tells the story of two friends, John Grady and Lacey Rawlins, who decide to travel to Mexico and end up in trouble when they try to recapture a stolen horse. What makes the story more accessible than most of the authorâ€™s work is that McCarthy allows his characters to fully interact with each other. Grady even falls in love with a woman, who is both developed and alluring â€“ a rarity in McCarthyâ€™s fictional universe. *** The best one McCarthy is intent on revealing the violence inherent in nearly every human endeavour. This is especially true in Blood Meridian, which is about a band of war veterans travelling through 19th-century America wreaking violence. Like much of McCarthyâ€™s work, the novel is near-plotless, so its beauty lies in its acutely lyrical language, weaving a tapestry through landscape and characters. *** The classic While Blood Meridian is widely considered McCarthyâ€™s greatest work, The Road has been recognised as a classic in its own right, particularly within post-apocalyptic fiction. In the aftermath of an unexplained global catastrophe, an unnamed man and his son trek through the burnt landscape that was once America. The bleak, searing setting and relentlessly visceral language might seem like a journey into an impenetrable darkness, but this devastating, tender novel will speak straight to your heart. *** The one to give a miss I think all McCarthyâ€™s work is brilliant, but if youâ€™re going to miss one out it should be the middle book of the Border Trilogy, The Crossing. While the language soars as ever, McCarthyâ€™s gaze here is much narrower. Much of it revolves around the journey of Billy Parham, who is trying to cross the US-Mexican border with a wolf. The novel harbours environmentalist sentiments and is in some ways reminiscent of Jack Londonâ€™s The Call of the Wild. But the story is not his most exciting, and Parhamâ€™s lack of interaction with other humans will test readersâ€™ patience. *** The one thatâ€™s not for the faint-hearted Child of God has a classic McCarthyian plot: a degenerate, stripped of all familial relations and alone in the world, drifting. Lester Ballardâ€™s story is told through a third-person impersonator â€“ as I have come to refer to McCarthyâ€™s narrators, since they break all conventions of the third-person narrator. It is this voice which pronounces Ballard, a character who kills and abuses the scant inhabitants of the forests of Appalachia, a â€œchild of Godâ€<9d>. There are acts here that would shock even the most ardent of McCarthyâ€™s fans. *** The one that deserves more attention Suttree, McCarthyâ€™s fourth novel, is, in my opinion, one of the most artistically satisfying of the modern era. It focuses on the titular Suttree, a man who lives alone in a dilapidated houseboat on the Tennessee River, having abandoned his wife and son. He has no clear attachment to anything and the romantic relationships he pursues all end badly. McCarthy never allows his third-person narrator to delve into his charactersâ€™ psyches, instead presenting them through gestures. But it is through these gestures that we get a full image of a truly memorable character. â€¢ An Orchestra of Minorities by Chigozie Obioma is published by Abacus (Â£8.99).

The testimony relates to a raid by Australian SAS troops on a compound called Whiskey 108, in the village of Kakarak in Uruzgan province on 12 April 2009, the site of two key allegations made by newspapers in their defence to Roberts-Smithâ€™s defamation claim: that he was involved in the execution of two unarmed men found in the compound. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of reports he alleges portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing, including the newspaperâ€™s claims regarding Whiskey 108. Subpoenaed by the newspapers to give evidence in the case against his former comrade, the still-serving SAS soldier, anonymised as Person 40 before the court, said once the Australian troops had â€œfought-throughâ€<9d> the heavily bombed compound, they found a small tunnel, secreted in a courtyard. Person 40 said Australian soldiers â€“ through an interpreter â€“ called for anybody hiding inside the tunnel to come out, and two Australian soldiers went in. Person 40 told the court two Afghan men came out of the tunnel. â€œOnce they came out, they were obviously very frightened. One had a distinctive limp, thatâ€™s the person with the prosthetic leg. â€œImmediately coming out of his tunnel he was lifting his trousers, pointing to the prosthetic leg, expecting some sympathy from the troops.â€<9d> Person 40 said the second man was balding and had a beard. He said the men were searched, â€œand from there they were marched off to another area, by Ben Roberts-Smith and Person 35 [another Australian soldier]â€<9d>. â€œMy understanding is that they would be TQed (tactically questioned), and Ben Roberts-Smith was the lead TQer on the ground. [TQ is] a quick set of questions to get some information and gain some advantage.â€<9d> Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Person 40 said he expected the men to be taken back to the Australiansâ€™ Tarin Kowt base: â€œThatâ€™s the SOP (standard operating procedure).â€<9d> But, under questioning, Person 40 told the court no prisoners were taken back to Tarin Kowt from that mission. He said he believed the men were Taliban. Person 40 said he was later standing guard when he heard a burst of gunfire fired â€œfrom about 30 metres awayâ€<9d>. He did not see the shots fired, but recognised by sound the weapon as an F89 Para Minimi machine gun, which was carried by few Australian soldiers. Leaving Whiskey 108 at the conclusion of the raid, Person 40 said he walked past the dead body of the man with the prosthetic leg lying outside the compound. Shown a picture of the slain man in court, Person 40 said he recognised him as the man with the prosthetic leg found in the tunnel, and that he had seen the picture previously, stuck to the wall of the SASâ€™s unofficial Afghan bar on base, the Fat Ladiesâ€™ Arms. So far in this trial, four Australian soldiers have told the court they saw two men emerge alive and unarmed from the tunnel at Whiskey 108. One of those soldiers has given evidence he put his head and shoulders in the tunnel and saw the men in there. A fifth soldier has given evidence he saw the men at the tunnel entrance in the custody of Australian troops. Lawyers for Roberts-Smith have put it to each of those witnesses that their testimony about people in the tunnel was false. One soldier, Person 41, told the court he later saw Roberts-Smith â€œfrogmarchâ€<9d> the man with a prosthetic leg outside the compound, throw him to the ground and machine-gun him to death. Under cross-examination, Person 41 conceded he had not reported what he had allegedly seen to his superiors because he â€œjust wanted to keep quiet about the whole thingâ€<9d>. â€œI was a new trooper, on my very trip with the SAS... itâ€™s the unwritten rule â€“ you go along with whatever happens,â€<9d> he said. Another soldier, Person 14, said he saw an unidentified Australian soldier carrying a distinctive weapon, a Minimi machine gun, throw a human-shaped object to the ground and fire a burst of bullets into it. He said he later saw Roberts-Smith carrying a Minimi during that mission but said he did not intend to suggest that Roberts-Smith was involved in the shooting and that other members of the patrol â€œpotentiallyâ€<9d> carried Minimis. Roberts-Smith has consistently denied those versions of events, describing them as â€œcompletely falseâ€<9d>. He said no people were taken out of the tunnel in the compound. â€œThere were no people in the tunnel at Whiskey 108,â€<9d> he told the court. In his evidence last year, he said he killed the man with a prosthetic leg outside Whiskey 108 because the man was a legitimate target, armed and running, and was killed in accordance with troopsâ€™ rules of engagement. â€œ[He was] not running directly at me, but coming on an arc,â€<9d> Roberts-Smith told the court. â€œHe had his hand over the top of the weapon, because he was carrying it down next to his body like thatâ€¦ hunched over, as in, running like that with his shoulders down.â€<9d> Under cross-examination on Wednesday, Arthur Moses put it to Person 40 that his testimony was incorrect, and that he had invented details, such as the presence of an interpreter on the mission. â€œThere was no interpreter there on that day. What do you say about that?â€<9d> â€œI disagree,â€<9d> Person 40 said. â€œHave you always had that memory?â€<9d> â€œThatâ€™s the truth.â€<9d> Moses put it to Person 40 he was removed from his patrol for poor performance and situational awareness. Person 40 said that was incorrect and that he was asked to take responsibility for training Afghan National Army soldiers during that deployment. Person 40 remains a serving member of the SAS. The newspapers allege in their defence that a second man allegedly pulled out of the tunnel at Whiskey 108, an elderly man, was executed by another Australian soldier on Roberts-Smithâ€™s orders. Roberts-Smith denies being involved in any execution at Whiskey 108, or any unlawful killings during his service in Afghanistan, and says there were no people in the tunnel and he did not give an order to execute anybody. The court has previously heard the prosthetic leg of the man killed on the mission was souvenired by another soldier and taken back to the Australian barracks where it was used as a celebratory drinking vessel. There is no evidence Roberts-Smith ever drank from the leg, and he has told the court he never did. Person 40 remains in the witness box.

While the rough release schedule is more than certain to change (a number of January releases have already moved as a result of Omicron), what it does do is show us what the industry is banking on right now, outside of the bread-and-butter business of superheroes. Hereâ€™s a look at what youâ€™ll be seeing the most of in 2022: Whodunnits It seems odd that a genre as reliably rewarding as the whodunnit was ever not in fashion but after star-packed murder mysteries dominated the multiplex throughout the 70s and 80s, the years since saw a retreat to the small screen. It took Kenneth Branaghâ€™s lavish, if creatively redundant, remake of Murder on the Orient Express to remind studios of audience interest, making a shock $351m worldwide back in 2017. This year sees the belated follow-up, a redo of Death on the Nile with a slightly less impressively starry cast â€“ PenÃ©lope Cruz, Johnny Depp, Judi Dench and Michelle Pfeiffer replaced with Gal Gadot, Armie Hammer, Russell Brand and Annette Bening â€“ landing in February. Later this year will also see a Netflix sequel to Rian Johnsonâ€™s 2019 hit Knives Out, officially untitled as of now but tentatively called Knives Out 2 because probably, bringing back Daniel Craig and sending him to Greece to find a killer from a cast including Kathryn Hahn, Edward Norton, Janelle MonÃ¡e and Kate Hudson. The streamer paid over $450m for the rights to the franchise. Saoirse Ronan and Sam Rockwell will also hunt for a murderer in the West End in See How They Run, with a cast of suspects including Ruth Wilson, David Oyelowo and Adrien Brody. A high school reunion ends in murder in the comedy Reunion which stars Jillian Bell and Lil Rel Howery (a set-up thatâ€™s almost identical to Appleâ€™s new series The Afterparty with Tiffany Haddish and Ilana Glazer) while Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston are currently filming Murder Mystery 2 for Netflix so that could also be a late addition. Slashers Another once-prolific genre that then fell out of favour, the slasher has seen a surprise resurgence in the past few years thanks to the box office success of Happy Death Day and the return of Halloween. Cheaply produced and based on an easily replicated formula, itâ€™s also found its obvious place within the world of streaming with Netflixâ€™s Fear Street trilogy and Thereâ€™s Someone Inside Your House and Amazonâ€™s I Know What You Did Last Summer remake. This month sees the inevitable return of Ghostface in Scream, a much-anticipated franchise-restarter bringing back the original Campbell-Cox-Arquette trio for more meta mayhem (if it makes as much as analysts predict it could lead to even more slashers in 2023). Next month, Leatherface follows suit in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, a tortured production sold to Netflix during the pandemic, another attempt to relaunch the grimy gore-heavy series, with Donâ€™t Breatheâ€™s Fede Alvarez involved as writer-producer and Eighth Gradeâ€™s Elsie Fisher starring. Michael Myers will also be making his â€œfinalâ€<9d> stab at killing Laurie Strode, AKA Jamie Lee Curtis, later in the year with Halloween Ends but the mammoth box office for his return might extend the originally envisioned trilogy. Thereâ€™s also the intriguing prospect of an A24 slasher from Cat Personâ€™s Kristen Roupenian called Bodies, Bodies, Bodies about a game that goes awry starring Maria Bakalova, Amandla Stenberg and Pete Davidson. Cerebral sci-fi While science-fiction that tackles something a little chewier than whether Godzilla or Kong can punch the hardest is never exactly not a thing, the next year provides a steadier stream than usual of options aiming more for mind over matter. After a premiere at Cannes last summer, Columbus director Kogonadaâ€™s After Yang will hit cinemas in March, a quiet drama with Colin Farrell and Jodie Turner-Smith about a family trying to save their live-in robot from extinction. David Cronenberg returns later this year with Crimes of the Future, a horror-tinged sci-fi tale set in a distant future where people explore â€œthe limitless potential of transhumanismâ€<9d>, said people including Kristen Stewart and Viggo Mortensen. Cronenbergâ€™s son Brandon will also follow his well-received Sundance hit Possessor with Infinity Pool, a thriller starring Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd and Mia Goth as a rich couple who discover something unusual beyond the gates of their all-inclusive resort. Yorgos Lanthimos is also reuniting with The Favourite screenwriter Tony McNamara and star Emma Stone for Poor Things, a Victorian era Frankenstein-esque tale of a woman brought back to life by a scientist who replaces her brain with that of her unborn child. One of the most intriguing big bets comes from the Mad Max director George Miller and his epic romance Three Thousand Years of Longing about a lonely scholar whose encounter with a wish-granting djinn leads to unexpected consequences. And while plot details are yet to be revealed, Jordan Peeleâ€™s mysterious new film Nope, starring Daniel Kaluuya, has debuted a poster that hints at a sci-fi mind-trip. Fan favourite sequels A look ahead at any year in the past five decades would show an unhealthy smattering of 2s, 3s and colons but in 2022, thereâ€™s a more specific form of sequel thatâ€™s set to dominate. Long-awaited, fan-petitioned follow-ups will be cosying up against the more expected superhero fare, studios betting on nostalgia to drive audiences out to the big screen or to stream. The aforementioned Scream is the first big test, to see if a 90s-born franchise can still pack â€™em in, weeks before Paramount also bets on Jackass Forever, the first entry from the team since 2010. The oft-delayed Top Gun: Maverick will also test if audiences still feel the need for both speed and Tom Cruise outside of the Mission: Impossible franchise (his only fruitful endeavour these days). Reese Witherspoonâ€™s belated return as Elle Woods in Legally Blonde 3 is allegedly set for a summer release (although recent reports suggest that might not happen) with help from Mindy Kaling scripting. Halloween will see the return of sister witches Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy in Hocus Pocus 2, after much fan speculation, haunting a new generation on Disney+ while the platform will also see Amy Adams returning as a fish-out-of-water princess in Disenchanted. And finally, Kevin Smith will complete his cult comedy trilogy with Clerks III. Bruce Willis It might be a surprise to anyone who doesnâ€™t spend hours scouring the very bottom rows of the streaming underworld but Bruce Willis is working harder than you, I or anyone we know. His admirably consistent brand of cheaply made action thrillers is ever-expanding (he was in nine films in 2021) and in 2022, he will star in another 10 VHS-era films tailored toward the most undemanding of viewers. In the next 12 months, he will be â€œseenâ€<9d> in Gasoline Alley with Luke Wilson, Fortress 2 with Shannen Doherty, A Day to Die with Frank Grillo, The Wrong Place with Ashley Greene, Vendetta with Mike Tyson, Corrective Measures with Michael Rooker, Die Like Lovers with Dominic Purcell, White Elephant with John Malkovich, Paradise City with John Travolta and Wire Room with Kevin Dillon.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

The resources minister, Keith Pitt, announced on Wednesday that three grants worth $19.4m would be given to Empire Energy to incentivise exploratory drilling in the Northern Territoryâ€™s Beetaloo Basin, a region the Morrison government wants to open up as part of its gas-led recovery. The decision has prompted anger among environmentalists and Indigenous groups, who have said fracking the Beetaloo Basin would drive up Australiaâ€™s emissions by 13%. â€œThis is a carbon bomb of extraordinary proportions that will scupper any chance of meeting the Paris targets,â€<9d> Environment Centre NT co-director Dr Kirsty Howey told the Guardian. â€œItâ€™s completely unreasonable for the minister to be approving these grants.â€<9d> Pittâ€™s announcement follows a federal court ruling in December that previous grants given to Empire worth $21m â€“ almost half the available funding from the $50m Beetaloo Cooperative Drilling Program â€“ were invalid. The court slammed the government for signing the final agreements while a legal challenge brought by the Environment Centre NT was under way, ruling the actions rendered the grants invalid. But the court dismissed the Environment Centre NTâ€™s main argument that the minister should have considered the fracking planâ€™s impact on global heating before announcing the grants, leaving it open for the government to reissue the grants. During the case, lawyers for the Environment Centre presented modelling evidence that fracking in the Beetaloo Basin could drive up Australiaâ€™s emissions by 13%, using up the rest of Australiaâ€™s carbon budget under the Paris Agreement. The courtâ€™s decision paved the way for the money to be re-announced on Wednesday. Pitt said the government was â€œcommitted to a gas-led recoveryâ€<9d> and opening up the Beetaloo. â€œThese grants will assist in that important process,â€<9d> he said. â€œAustralian gas is in high demand domestically and internationally and itâ€™s important that we work to get new gas production online.â€<9d> A Senate inquiry has previously probed Empire Energyâ€™s links to the Liberal party. The inquiry has heard Empire has donated to the NTâ€™s Country Liberal party and flew a Liberal party fundraising chair to inspect its operations. Empire is chaired by Paul Espie, a frequent Liberal donor and director of the Menzies Research Centre, the inquiry has heard. The company told the inquiry the links played â€œno role whatsoeverâ€<9d> in its applications for the grants and that it followed â€œdue and proper process at all timesâ€<9d>. Johnny Wilson, who chairs the Nurrdalinji Native Title Aboriginal Corporation, lives in Lightning Ridge, not far from Empireâ€™s proposed wells. He said in a statement that the $19.4m would be far better spent on â€œessential services our communities need, like housing, education, health and roadsâ€<9d>. â€œThe government is doing the wrong thing backing fracking on our country, it is poisoning our water, our animals and upsetting the songlines that run across our land,â€<9d> he said. Pitt said activists opposed to fracking in the region â€œthreaten future energy security both here in Australia and in countries around the world that rely on our LNG exportsâ€<9d>. â€œThe Beetaloo sub-basin has the potential to be a world-class gas resource that could create thousands of jobs and bolster domestic and international gas supply,â€<9d> he said. â€œThe taxes and royalties that are generated from the resources sector allow state and federal governments to provide the health, education and other essential services all Australians rely on.â€<9d> Pitt was the headline speaker at an Energy Club NT event on Tuesday evening, which cost almost $1,000 per table to attend. A positive Covid diagnosis forced him to give the speech remotely. Activists, including those from the Protect Country Alliance, rallied outside the event. Protect Country Alliance spokesperson Graeme Sawyer said the fracking plan would only benefit a â€œminusculeâ€<9d> number of people, saying the majority of the gas would be exported. â€œNinety-nine point nine per cent of Territorians wonâ€™t benefit from this industry - instead we will suffer as fracking pollutes our rivers and groundwater, and drives dangerous climate change that is already leading to never before seen heat records in the Top End,â€<9d> he said.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Music sung by her was heard constantly across India, in shops, restaurants, taxis or on the radio, and she became known as â€œDidiâ€<9d>, or sister, because so many people identified with her often emotional songs. And yet she was best known as a playback singer, a vocalist who does not appear onscreen but provides the soundtrack for films in which actors lip sync to her singing. Her output was extraordinary â€“ she is estimated to have recorded some 25,000 songs, which appeared in more than a 1,000 Hindi films, and she also sang in more than 20 different Indian languages. With an impressive vocal range, covering four octaves, she became massively popular with film directors for her ability to understand the context in which her songs would be used. Mangeshkar did not just sing, but made sure that her performance matched the storyline and the character, saying that she always read the lyrics and listened to the tune before agreeing to sing. She first came to national fame in India with the song Aayega Aanewala (meaning â€œthe one who is destined to come will definitely comeâ€<9d>), which she recorded in 1949 while still a teenager. A charming and dramatic song, which featured in the film Mahal that year, it was the start of a remarkable career in which she interpreted work by all the major Indian film composers. For more than three decades she recorded hundreds of songs by the composing duo of Laxmikant-Pyarelal (Laxmikant Shantaram Kudalkar and Pyarelal Ramprasad Sharma), including such hits as Sheesha Ho Ya Dil Ho (from the film Aasha, in 1980). She also worked with SD Burman, and later with his celebrated son the composer RD Burman (who would marry her sister Asha), recording RD Burman songs including Bahon Mein Chale Aao (from the film Anamica, 1973). Later she collaborated with the most internationally celebrated Bollywood composer, AR Rahman, and sang several of his best known songs including Jiya Jale (from the 1998 romantic thriller Dil Se) and Luka Chuppi (from the 2006 film Rang De Basanti), which she recorded when she was in her mid-70s. Rahman remembered how carefully she would rehearse: â€œShe would sit with her assistant, and would start singing very slowly, with every lyric clear.â€<9d> She was, he said, â€œpart of a soul, part of a consciousness of Indiaâ€<9d>. If she had any competition as Indiaâ€™s finest playback singer, it was from her younger sister Asha Bhosle. After all, it was Asha who had Cornershopâ€™s 1997 hit Brimful of Asha written about her, and who had recorded the most number of songs (according to The Guinness Book of World Records Lata was ahead in 1974 but Asha overtook her), and it was Asha who recorded with the experimental Kronos Quartet. Lata insisted there was no sibling rivalry, saying; â€œweâ€™re very close, we never competed with each other.â€<9d> Mangeshkar was born in Indore, in what is now Madhya Pradesh state, the oldest child of Shevanti (later renamed Shuddhamati) and Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar, a musician and teacher who ran a touring theatre company. Lata never went to school, as she quit on the first day when the teacher refused to allow her to bring her then 10-month-old sister Asha into the classroom. Much of her childhood was spent singing alongside her father at concerts. He died in 1942, when she was 13, and she then had to support her mother and four siblings. A close family friend, Vinayak Damodar Karnataki, offered her work with his film company Navyug Chitrapat, acting in minor roles. When the company moved to Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1945, she and her family moved with them. She said she disliked acting â€œbecause I was very small and hated putting on makeup and having to laugh and cry in front of the camerasâ€<9d>. But she loved playback singing, and was given her first break with a song in the film Majboor (1948). Then came the film Mahal, which included her hit song, and she rapidly became known as Indiaâ€™s Playback Queen. Though most celebrated for her film work, she also gave concerts in India and abroad.

In 1974 she performed many of her Bollywood hits at the Royal Albert Hall in London, backed by musicians including SD Burman, and was hailed as the first Indian artist to have performed there.

The son of two of Britainâ€™s most well-known actors, John Le Mesurier and Hattie Jacques, Robin described his 1960s childhood in his birthplace of Earlâ€™s Court, London, as â€œcharmed, bohemian but also chaoticâ€<9d>. Woken up in the middle of the night by the likes of Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers, as well as various jazz musicians jamming loudly in the house, didnâ€™t seem out of the ordinary. â€œTo me, visitors such as Kenneth Williams, Joan Sims and Harry Secombe were just friends and colleagues of Mum and Dad,â€<9d> he said. Schooldays were not his happiest: he attended Sussex House prep school in London, where he described himself as being â€œcompletely out of placeâ€<9d>, and then Westminster City grammar school, where he was bullied for having a famous mother. Given his first guitar at the age of nine, he cut his first single for EMI at the age of 16, and was then offered a place at the Royal College of Music. But the lure of rockâ€™nâ€™roll won out over classical music. His first band, Reign, opened for bands such as Genesis and the Kinks, and for a year in the 70s he became a Womble â€“ until a drugs bust ended his career as the furry Wellington. Robinâ€™s next band, Air Supply, was booked as support for Rod Stewartâ€™s US tour in 1977, and his guitar-playing made such an impression on Stewart that in 1981 he was asked to join his band â€“ a move that led him to settle permanently in Los Angeles. â€œIâ€™ve had many wonderful and creative guitarists in my band, but Robin was always just a cut above,â€<9d> said Stewart. â€œHe was a beautiful, soulful lead, driving rhythms like a locomotive, and an unforgettable stage presence.â€<9d> From 1994 Robin worked with Hallyday, becoming his musical director until Hallydayâ€™s death in 2017. Robin was also a founder member, with Bernie Taupin and the guitarist Jim Cregan, of the band Farm Dogs. I got to know Robin while working with him on his autobiography, and despite a history of rockâ€™nâ€™roll antics in which hotel rooms were trashed and copious amounts of drugs and drink were taken, he possessed a gentle, dry wit, and remained the sweetest and politest of men. His good manners were instilled in him from an early age by his parents, and were there with him always. I was with Robin one day when we went to see Hallyday in Los Angeles. They had known each other for 20 years and described themselves as â€œbrothersâ€<9d>. Yet when we arrived ten minutes before our appointed time, Robin insisted that we stay in the car as â€œit would be impolite to arrive earlyâ€<9d>.

I can hear the little babies shouting for their milk first thing in the early morning through my window. Their warm and fluffy little bodies are soft to touch and are so cuddly. Although sometimes the mums can get a bit overprotective and stomp their hooves to warn me off from picking them up. I will never forget one day watching a young lamb in a lush, green field on a warm, spring day bouncing through the tall grass chasing a curious amber butterfly. It made me think of a new start of the year full of joy and fun. When they are young the lambs are very curious and trusting, so they will approach people for a sniff and a pat on the head, just like woolly puppies. When they get a little older, and start escaping from their fields, catching them becomes impossible without a well-trained sheepdog to help. Sometimes I have to bottle-feed the newborns because their mums donâ€™t have any milk, which is such a special experience for me to watch their greedy little faces suck on the bottle like I am their mum.

The Queensland coronerâ€™s court has heard how Langham told officers on that morning â€“ 7 February 2021 â€“ that her former partner, Gary Hely, had threatened her. He told Langham she had â€œthree weeks to liveâ€<9d>. Fifteen days later she was killed in a house fire, along with Hely. The counsel assisting the state coroner, Ben Jackson, told a coronerâ€™s inquest on Monday that the police response to Langhamâ€™s plea for help was beset by â€œso many inadequaciesâ€<9d>. Langhamâ€™s complaints were â€œquite simply â€¦ not properly investigatedâ€<9d>, he said. The inquest is examining the police response, including several interactions between Langham and officers between 7 February and 22 February, the day Hely carried out his earlier threat. The court heard Hely had bought 10 litres of petrol, entered Langhamâ€™s Browns Plains home and set the property alight. A preliminary hearing last year had been told about a triple-zero call by Langham â€œseeking protectionâ€<9d> earlier that night. Jackson told the hearing that police took an hour to respond, knocked on the door of her unit, and left. In his opening address on Monday, Jackson told the courtroom Langham had endured â€œmany months of controlling and abusive behaviour by Mr Helyâ€<9d> before her first call to police on 7 February. â€œIn the morning heâ€™d made threats to Ms Langham that would send a chill down anyoneâ€™s spine. He said she had three weeks to live,â€<9d> Jackson said. â€œIt was a call to Policelink that alerted police initially to her concerns. They advised her not to return home â€¦ she went to a friendâ€™s place in Marsden. It was there that Ms Langhamâ€™s many personal interactions with police would begin. â€œTwo officers arrived â€¦ her interaction with those officers would be representative of so many inadequacies. â€œNot all police showed that level of inadequacy. Some understood Ms Langhamâ€™s concerns and the risks she faced, and they did what they could to help. Those positive actions were not enough.â€<9d> Langhamâ€™s death last year was one of a number that placed renewed focus on police handling of domestic violence cases. The Queensland government is considering a recommendation to hold a royal commission into police responses to domestic violence cases. The first witness at the inquest, a police officer, said she did not believe she was adequately trained. The officer broke down in tears in the witness box when asked what she would do differently about her interaction with Langham. â€œI wouldnâ€™t have had so much reliance on her presentation to me, her demeanour,â€<9d> the officer said. â€œI would have asked more probing questions. Could she provide messages to me? Did she have any further evidence of anything â€¦ that she could offer me? Was there any previous history between the two?â€<9d> Earlier, Jackson had said he did not suggest any officers had acted with malice towards Langham. â€œRather and quite simply, Ms Langhamâ€™s complaints were not properly investigated. â€œMs Langham had done all she could. Sheâ€™d shown herself to be â€¦ articulate. She knew the danger and the risks that Hely [presented] and as the days went by she did all she could to bring Hely to account and to try to get him to stop.â€<9d> Jackson said the events of the early morning of 22 February were â€œclearâ€<9d>. â€œHely entered her home. Itâ€™s almost impossible to think that Ms Langham let him in. He forced his entry. Hely brought with him an amount of petrol. Heâ€™d bought an amount of 10 litres the previous day while in the area. â€œHely â€¦ had a plan and that plan actually came about. Ms Langham would perish in her own home and that was due to a fire that Hely had started. â€œWhatever they were, and whatever your honour finds, one thing is clear: Ms Langhamâ€™s last moments must have been filled with utter terror.â€<9d> The court has temporarily suppressed the names of police officers giving evidence.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Tiffany Stevens, from Bolton, had feared 18-month-old Darcey Stevens and three-year-old Casey-Lea Taylor would be put into care after her death, the inquest heard. The 27-year-old gave her children lethal substances before taking a cocktail of drugs in the murder-suicide at the family home in Little Lever on 21 January 2019. Their bodies were not discovered for about a week. Stevens had spent five years in care herself as a child and endured a â€œtraumaticâ€<9d> upbringing after her father died of a drug overdose when she was five, Bolton coronerâ€™s court was told. Stevensâ€™s mother, Bobby-Jo, said her daughter was fixated on suicide from the age of 17. â€œFor Tiffany, she was going into another dimension and she would live on. She just thought the world was corrupt and bad, no matter how much we tried to reason with her,â€<9d> she said. Dr Adrian West, a forensic clinical psychologist, told the inquest that online searches relating to suicide methods were found on Stevensâ€™s phone. He said she had written that she was sorry for what was going to happen but she was unable to get over her past and had a mistrust of social services. Stevens took an overdose when she was 19 and went on be referred for mental health treatment on at least eight separate occasions between August 2011 and April 2017. However, she failed to attend the appointments. She had a history of self-harm and had been diagnosed as having traits of a borderline personality disorder, the inquest heard. While both children were known to social services, the inquest heard there were no grounds for the local authority to apply for Darcey and Casey-Lea to be removed from Stevensâ€™s care The bodies of Stevens and Casey-Lea were discovered under a duvet on a mattress in the living room, while Darcey was found in her pram near the front door of the property. The assistant coroner for West Manchester, Peter Sigee, concluded that the two children were unlawfully killed without suffering. He concluded that Stevens was of sound mind when she took her daughtersâ€™ lives and her actions would have constituted an offence of murder.

I have never met or heard of anyone with a surname such as Red, Purple or Blue. Is this the case in other languages? Stephen Riley, Ann Arbor, Michigan Send new questions to nq@theguardian.com. Readers reply All the purple people were eaten. TopGyre The late Rabbi Lionel Blue is an example. Perhaps someone knows the origin of the name? Janchan According to the rabbi himself, it was the other way round. Father came to England and needed a new surname. Noticed people called Brown, Black, etc. Personally he liked the colour blue, so took that name, only later to realise that no one else was called Blue. Pedant27A Blue is a surname! Just ask Mrs Blue, my great granny. More common in Scotland than England, though. Regularsubscriber One of the best blue names is Harald Bluetooth, a Viking king. Oddly, Bluetooth technology is named after him. ClaretEile Weirdly, there seems to be a concentration of Reds around Inverness. Yellows in Yorkshire, Purples in Norfolk and Blues in the mountains of Mourne, too ... Svalborealis What about Miss Scarlett and Colonel Mustard? DrEd Years ago, I worked in the MoD in Whitehall. There was a yellow directory that listed the names and numbers of people who worked in the MoD, including officers. One day, a colleague and myself were bored and going through it. We discovered a Captain Scarlet. So we rang him up. He picked up the phone and said: â€œHello, this is Captain Scarlet.â€<9d> To which I replied in a very deep voice: â€œThis is the voice of the Mysterons. We know that you can hear us,â€<9d> and then quickly put the phone down. Very childish but we laughed for hours. THeEgoHasLanded Actually, there is and English surname that means red. Itâ€™s Gough derived from the Welsh word for the colour red, â€œcochâ€<9d>. Berwyn Roderick Rogers comes from the french rouge or Rougier as a name so we do have red. fworcs The surname Russell is also believed to be derived from the Norman rus, meaning red (red-haired), and also an archaic name for a red fox. MrsLessing Were not the Norse Rus (red-haired Viking ancestors of the Normans) also responsible for the founding of Rus-sia (in Kyiv)? How appropriate that the Russians subsequently became the â€œredsâ€<9d>. ITGuyReader My surname is Redhead, so I get the comments about my red hair. Itâ€™s a Viking nickname, and the family hail from Northumbria, one of the areas where they landed and lived. My mumâ€™s maiden name is also colour-based: Fairhurst. Julia Redhead My mind went immediately to Red Cloud, the Oglala Lakota chief. Now, of course, his name originated in the Lakota language, but the United States is an English-speaking culture, and Red Cloud was his name in that language. There was also Red Shirt, from the same people. David Antrobus The surname Reid/Read/Reade comes from the Anglo-Saxon for red, and probably referred to hair colour. Red and russet are common surnames in other countries: Leroux, Rosso/Rossi. Black refers to swarthy skin, or black hair; and maybe Brown, too: Lenoir and Lebrun in French. A famous German soprano had the surname Schwarzkopf, referring to black hair. Gray/Grey refers to hair or beard colour, and is a translation from a fairly common Irish or Gaelic surname. (The surname Glass is a transliteration of Irish glÃ¡s, which can mean grey, blue or green according to context.) Green(e) refers to the verdure where someone lived: Verdi is a famous Italian name. German has a variety of surnames containing GrÃ¼n. Yellow is not an Anglophone surname, but French has LeJaune. Viol[l]et is also a French surname. Anthony Weir Black was common for blacksmiths, Brown for tanners, White for clothmakers, so we were told in school. lissameliss From around the 12th century, surnames developed from patronymics or matronymics, occupation, nicknames, proximity to a place, whether a local landmark or a named village or town, and descriptions. So Brown, White, Black or Grey easily came from hair colour, complexion â€“ or, in the case of Grey and White, age. The derivation of a surname may be concealed by its being from an occupation no longer common, or in an old form of English or from, say, Norman French. So a Fletcher was an arrow-maker, a Chapman was a pedlar and one called Atwood someone living atte (near) a wood. Mallory seems to be Anglo-Norman for â€œunluckyâ€<9d>! (My own surname suggests that wool-carding ancestors never bothered to progress to being Weavers, Websters or Webbers.) Jane Matilda Thick European family names are often derived from personal characteristics, such as hair colour or trade. Some names are obvious, like Carpenter or Baker, Short or Long. Some colours might be either. Black might be colouring or could be the trade of a Blacksmith. White could be the colour or, a trade name that fell out of use long ago, a Whitesmith, who worked with tin or lead. Green or other place names such as Hill are mostly assumed to be where they lived, as in village green. But there might be a suggestion of trade as for a greengrocer. leadballoon A Green I knew â€“ his family were originally Greenbaum â€“ was Jewish. A lot of Jews are Green-something or Gold-something, or even Roth-something, relating to their profession. Some of them in the UK shortened their names, especially during the first world war, when they were perceived as possibly being German due to their German-sounding surnames, and therefore likely to get their shop windows smashed. ohanyname Hate to ask a stupid question, but where are all the blondes? If weâ€™re pinning much of this down to hair colour, the browns, blacks, whites, greys and reds/Reids/Rosses seem to fit the formula, but where are the blondes? CDAEvans Blond(e) is the French term, so not established as an English name. elitemetropolitain Perhaps found in family names with â€œfairâ€<9d> in them? Mornex74 My middle name, Boyd, means blond or yellow. alexito The UK phone directory includes surnames such as Puce, Mint, Cerise, Cornflower and Mulberry. loudmouth No one ever seems to have been called Beige. SpleendeParis Gorm is often a nickname in Scottish Gaelic, blue-eyed (gorm in nature can also mean dark or matt). The surname Gormley might be it; it would follow the pattern that makes Donal(d) into Donnelly in English spelling. coultetscandi In Italy we have as surnames: Bianchi (white), Neri (black), Verdi (green), Viola (violet), Marrone (brown), Porpora (purple), Rosa (pink), Rossi (red), but no grey. Annina Lubbock Rossi (red) is thought to be the most common surname. However, I have not heard of Blu or Azzurri (blue) or Gialli (yellow). Viola (purple) does exist, though. Paolo Tomasi There are several colourful surnames in Spanish: AÃ±il (indigo), Blanco (white), CastaÃ±o (chestnut), Celeste (light blue), Dorado (golden), Monegro (contraction of Montenegro: black hill), Moreno (brown), NegrÃ­n (little black), Pardo (brown), Rojas (red), Rosado (pink), Rubio (blond), Morado (purple). Jordi P Amezcua In French, it is much the same as in English, except that Red is more common: Roux, Leroux, etc. Otherwise: Blanc, Leblanc, Blondel. Noir, Lenoir, Noiret. Lebrun, Brun. In German, Braun and Schwarz are obviously common. Blau is quite common as a name in German, I think (can also mean drunk). The red may be more subtle: Rotmund. But then again Schwarzkopf or Weisskopf are pretty clear. In a traditional areas of rural Switzerland, until recently it was common for (white) people to hold up a piece of their hair and say: â€œje suis noirâ€<9d> simply to emphasise that they might be easily recognised through their hair colour. Derek Christie, Geneva Rood (red) and Blauw (blue) occur as surnames in the Netherlands. Also Groen (green), Geel (yellow), Oranje (orange). Willem Driessen In Dutch, Paars (purple) doesnâ€™t exist as a surname, though Purper and especially Purperhart (purple heart) is a common surname from Suriname. skdeurloo Hereditary surnames were common in the Catholic south but not so much in the Protestant north. When the Netherlands was occupied by the French, Napoleon ordered a census and everyone had to give a family name. As an act of rebellion, many offered rather rude names which were dutifully noted down and still exist today. Names such as Poepjes (little shit), Naaktgeboren (born naked) and Naaktinhetveld (naked in the field). Omontaise In Danish, we have brown, white â€¦ but not blue or pink. Anders In Norway, RÃ¸d (red) is a fairly common surname, although it has nothing to do with the colour. RÃ¸d means â€œa place that has been clearedâ€<9d> eg in the woods, to make space for a farm and a plot of arable land. hildepilde In Czech, there is blue (Modry), there is almost a purple (Fiala â€“ whereas fialovy means purple). And Zeleny (green) is very common, you might recognise a famous holder of a similar name in current events (Zelenskiy). BlairwasagoodPM In Hungarian there is the surname VÃ¶rÃ¶s (red/deep red); one of Hungaryâ€™s most famous poets is VÃ¶rÃ¶smarty, while another (old form) is WeÃ¶res. Staying with writers, Krasznahorkai is from a Slavic root (krasni) meaning red, and indeed Krasny, or some variation on that, is also a family name in Slavic countries. SÃ¡rga (yellow) is also a Hungarian family name, though not common, as is SzÅ‘ke (blonde/fair). Me, Iâ€™ve been struggling with my surname for years now! Paul Thatcher, Budapest In Romanian, RoÅŸu (meaning red) is a surname, too. My conjecture is that these colour surnames are based on the most common colours encountered in a specific culture. For example, red is very common in Romaniaâ€™s national folk costumes. We donâ€™t have Grey and Brown as surnames; only Red, Black, White and rarely Green. Maria-Luiza Apostolescu Roussos and Roussakis (red) as well as Kitrinos/Kitrinakis (yellow) are common Greek surnames. sirah7767 The common Chinese name Huang means yellow. Joe, Canada è“<9d> (lÃ¡n) meaning blue can be a family name in China. Liuzhoukaf Hong? Red, I seem to remember. Must admit I donâ€™t personally know anyone with that name though. BluebellWood Long ago in Japan, the Lady Murasaki wrote what is said to be the worldâ€™s first novel. In Japanese, murasaki means purple. Janchan And the Japanese surname Akai means red. KrisW1001 Someone (Victor Borge or PDQ Bach, I forget which) liked to point out that famous Italian composers Giuseppe Verdi and Gioachino Rossetti are less highbrow sounding as Joe Green and Jake Red. Thereâ€™s a noted American Sherlockian, Peter Blau, whose name is German for Blue. Less common, certainly, but there are some. Iâ€™d imagine that Brown, White, and Black (and Grey) originally are descriptors of skin tones (or maybe hair colours â€“ although youâ€™d expect more reds and some yellows, in that case), and green an occupational name for someone dealing with growing plants. The main sources of last names are personal descriptions, occupations, patronymics and places-of-origin. The list of names sent out for picking from by the Kaiser were more variegated with lots of names such as goldstone, redstone, feather or bearman that probably came off the list without any particular connection to the recipient. You get a lot of reds and yellows in with all those goldens and rosens. Bernstein means amber, but isnâ€™t the colour amber â€“ it means burn-stone. Ruth Berman I was told by a Welshman (called Jones) that old Welsh surnames virtually disappeared after the first census (I donâ€™t know when that was). He told me that most Welsh people were illiterate and the census details were mainly recorded by the English, who couldnâ€™t spell the Welsh names, so they asked for the Christian name of the personâ€™s father. If it was John, they recorded Jones, Evan became Evans and David became Davis. The names of the aristocracy would have survived, the obvious one being Llewellyn. carolburrows",FALSE,"pillar/lifestyle","Lifestyle"

He discovers that his teen vampire daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) has fallen for the lost human backpacker, Johnny (Andy Samberg) who shows up at the hotel by accident. The 2015 sequel, co-written by Sandler, had Mavis and Johnny present Count Dracula with a grandchild and the 2018 threequel sent them all off on a frantically unfunny summer vacation.

The non-premise now is that Dracula is thinking of leaving the hotel to Mavis and Johnny, but his son-in-lawâ€™s outrageous incompetence makes him have second thoughts; so he lies and tells Jonny there is a law that only monsters can inherit the hotel.

They probably park themselves outside Smart Pizza for the central location and because of the rainbow flag draped in front of the restaurant. â€œWe canâ€™t get away from it. We can hear them in our living rooms!â€<9d> he said, adding that they repeat the same chants. â€œâ€˜This town is gonna burn!

But these protesters are different. â€œThe group is very active,â€<9d> he said. So locals like him are also taking a different approach to counter-protest, and appear to have succeeded in driving the protesters out. As the protesters descended from out of town, always on Wednesdays, harassed passersby, and told locals not to eat at Smart Pizza or other LGBTQ+-friendly businesses, according to Hamlin and fellow townspeople Suzy Kuhr and Dax Berg, they have been met by the self-named Pizza Box Brigade. The Brigade is made up of 30 or so locals who organized via group text and greet the protesters with messages including â€œHate is toxicâ€<9d> and â€œJesus loves me and my boyfriendâ€<9d> painted on pizza boxes. â€œIt started with my employee, who went out there with a decorated box,â€<9d> says Suzy Kuhr, who has worked at Smart Pizza for more than 20 years and has owned it since 2015. Word spread fast, and a district supervisor â€œposted a pic of my employee with his box saying â€˜Fuck these peopleâ€™â€<9d> adding the online comment, â€œOne of the things Iâ€™m thankful for today was Pizza Box Guy.â€<9d> Gay and straight alike, residents quickly responded and came out in droves to paint their own boxes. Hamlin has heard this group was also protesting in the nearby upscale wine country town of Sebastopol. But Guerneville, approximately 80 miles (130 km) north of San Francisco, with its pride flags and welcoming spirit, truly drew their ire. A 19th-century logging town, Guerneville began attracting queer visitors in the 1970s, becoming home to a number of resorts with a strong gay clientele, plus several annual LGBTQ+-themed weekends and a famous bingo game run by the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a troupe of drag nuns. A Provincetown or Fire Island Pines of rugged western Sonoma, Guernevilleâ€™s small downtown would be a fairly obvious choice for organized homophobes. The protesters were simultaneously very vocal and tight-lipped, Hamlin said, refusing to explain their presence or what organization they represented. These actions are part of a nationwide resurgence of homophobic and transphobic sentiment, with the spread of censorious â€œdonâ€™t say gayâ€<9d> legislation, â€œanti-groomingâ€<9d> rallies at Disneyworld, and the firebombing of a Brooklyn gay bar. As the protesters were confronted with ever-growing and better-publicized pushback from Guerneville residents, the outsiders seem to have moved on. (Unseasonably cold, drizzly weather the most recent Wednesday may also have been a factor.) If the goal was to shut Smart Pizza down, the protests had the opposite effect. â€œIf anything, itâ€™s brought me more business,â€<9d> Kuhr says. â€œI had two or three people who came in last week. Theyâ€™d read about it in the paper, saying they want to support us.â€<9d> Dax Berg, who owns Sonoma Nesting Company nearby, said he would set up a stereo to blast Johnny Cashâ€™s Personal Jesus and other curated songs. â€œThe realty office and the bank would call me and say, â€˜Would you put your music on?â€™ Thatâ€™s Godâ€™s way of smiling at me,â€<9d> Berg says. â€œWhen you are bullied, you need to defend yourself in the most effective, judicious manner.â€<9d> The Pizza Brigadeâ€™s message has spread throughout the town, with locals asking to borrow pizza boxes so they can join in. â€œThere was a little old lady, who must have been 85,â€<9d> Berg said. â€œAnd she asked, â€˜Do you have one for me?â€™ She took a â€˜Love is loveâ€™.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Louis Lozano and Eric Mitchell were asked to respond to a robbery in progress with â€œmultiple suspectsâ€<9d> at a Macyâ€™s in south-west LA, but failed to respond to radio calls. An investigation revealed that Lozano and Mitchell heard the call but chose to ignore it in favor of pursuing a nearby Snorlax, a PokÃ©mon character. A video system in the pairâ€™s car revealed that Mitchell managed to capture the Snorlax before the pair drove to a location where the Togetic character had been spotted. On arrival, both Lozano and Mitchell managed to capture the Togetic. The incident occurred in April 2017 but details were revealed by an appeals court on Friday. Vice first reported on the case. Lozano and Mitchell were fired following an investigation, but appealed. The court upheld their dismissal. The recording from Lozano and Mitchellâ€™s car captured the pair discussing PokÃ©mon Go, an augmented reality mobile game where users travel to different locations. According to court documents, minutes after the officers were asked to respond to the Macyâ€™s robbery, â€œOfficer Mitchell alerted Lozano that Snorlax â€˜just popped upâ€™ at â€˜46th and Leimertâ€™.â€<9d> The court reported: â€œAfter Mitchell apparently caught the Snorlax â€“ exclaiming, â€˜Got â€™emâ€™ â€“ petitioners agreed to â€˜[g]o get the Togeticâ€™ and drove off. â€œWhen their car stopped again, the [digital in-car video system] recorded Mitchell saying, â€˜Donâ€™t run away.

The court disagreed. Bulbapedia.net, a community-sourced PokÃ©mon encyclopedia, describes Snorlax as a â€œhuge, bipedal, dark blue-green PokÃ©mon with a cream-colored face, belly, and feetâ€<9d>.

Based on the mapping of Irelandâ€™s landscape in the 1830s, Frielâ€™s play has been performed all over the world since its premiere by Field Day in 1980. Director CaitrÃ­ona McLaughlin highlights its universality, avoiding sentimentality, with designers Joanna Parker (set) and Paul Keogan (lighting) creating a strikingly abstract stage picture: a sloping ridge evoking a cottage roof against a summer nightâ€™s sky. In Donegal, where place names are being translated into English for Ordnance Survey maps, the English soldiers tasked with this exercise are assisted by a local man. Owen (Leonard Buckley) mediates between them and the villagers, who speak Irish only. When Lieutenant Yolland (Aidan Moriarty) becomes enthralled by the Irish language and landscape, he is teased by Owen for his misty romanticism: â€œThe first hot summer in 50 years and you think itâ€™s Eden.â€<9d> Change is encroaching on all fronts, as the makeshift hedge schools that teach Latin and Greek literature through Irish are about to be replaced by national schools where English will be compulsory. Owenâ€™s father, the erudite and bibulous Hugh (Brian Doherty) and his put-upon son Manus (Marty Rea), both teachers, are forced to grapple with questions of language, communication and identity, personal and political. Refusing to speak English to the soldiers, Manus resents Owenâ€™s pragmatism, while Owen finds himself caught uneasily between two cultures. Although every character in this ensemble is given clarity and depth through subtle performances, the love scene between Yolland and Maire (Zara Devlin) has less emotional impact here than the tense interaction between the two brothers, compellingly played by Rea and Buckley. Is their old language a barrier to progress, as Maire believes? Offering to teach her English, Hugh makes telling observations on the limitations of language, while articulating what is being lost. Often pompous, sometimes ridiculous, Dohertyâ€™s Hugh also has immense dignity. His proud assertion to the soldiers of his affinity with European culture emphasises the central, resonant idea: that identity is complicated â€“ and not binary.

In a secret ballot held on Wednesday, 73 Conservative parliamentarians voted to remove Erin Oâ€™Toole as leader. Forty-five voted for him to keep his job. The vote comes as potential candidates to replace Oâ€™Toole have embraced a well-funded protest in Ottawa over vaccine mandates and public health measures, spearheaded by far-right groups. Oâ€™Toole, a former air navigator, took the partyâ€™s top job in 2020. But support for him collapsed after he was unable to topple Justin Trudeauâ€™s Liberal party in the September 2021 election. In the months since, Oâ€™Toole has battled restlessness within the party, facing accusations that his positions on a carbon tax and assault weapons are inconsistent and that he has driven a wedge through the Conservatives over social issues, including LGBTQ protections. Earlier this week, 35 of the partyâ€™s 118 members of parliament signed a letter calling for a change in leadership, effectively forcing the vote on Oâ€™Tooleâ€™s political future. â€œI am asking for your support, colleagues. I am asking to have the courage to give a chance to our teams,â€<9d> he said during the caucus meeting. â€œYou have been heard. My goal will be to bring us together.â€<9d> Oâ€™Toole, a four-term MP, had previously warned that a tack to the right risked losing any gains the party had made and would set it up for another loss to the Liberal party. Oâ€™Tooleâ€™s challenges have also come from former caucus members, who sent a letter earlier this week calling for a change in leadership. â€œErin Oâ€™Toole has not only failed to unite the party, his words and actions in recent days have created greater disunity. It is time for him to step aside for the good of the Conservative party and the nation,â€<9d> the former MPs wrote. Wednesdayâ€™s vote marks the second time Conservatives have searched for a leader during the coronavirus pandemic and comes amid questions over the trajectory of the partyâ€™s policies.

On a sandbank bounded by a river and warm wet forests in whatâ€™s now the dusty North Dakota prairies, triceratops and tyrannosaurs laid eggs, roamed, did their late Cretaceous thing. Thescelosaurs and turtles swam in the river. Pterosaurs flew overhead and furry mammalian creatures burrowed underground. On one of the most important days in Planet Earthâ€™s history, as only David Attenborough can so portentously pronounce it, life went on in abundance. Until an asteroid bigger than Mount Everest hit what is now Mexicoâ€™s Yucatan peninsula with an explosion whose force was greater than that of a billion Hiroshima bombs. In less than two hours, the world as we never knew it was for ever changed. We donâ€™t know exactly when the asteroid hit. But within 40 minutes, the consequences 2,000 miles away at Tanis â€“ the name given to the Dakotan sandbank by the palaeontologists who have been digging there for a decade â€“ were profound. Dinosaurs: The Final Day With David Attenborough (BBC One) recreates those last terrifying minutes as wildfires, earthquakes, tsunamis and seismic waves ravaged the globe and all life at Tanis was swiftly entombed in sediment. For context, this was 60m years before we pitched (or rather stood) up. And weâ€™re seeing in real time how thatâ€™s panning out. Thatâ€™s just the last half-hour of Dinosaurs: The Final Day. And itâ€™s disturbingly prescient for something that happened 66m years ago. I found myself sloshing back and forth, much like the Norwegian fjords mysteriously did in 2011 after an earthquake hit Japan, while watching this slick, gripping and elegiac feature-length documentary. Lurching from abject despair at our our contemporary role in this history to profound awe at our ability to unearth its deep mysteries. The signature Attenborough cocktail of feelings, then. One of my scribbled notes simply reads: â€œWe are the asteroid.â€<9d> Dinosaurs: The Final Day deftly uses state-of-the-art FX and a virtual production studio, which I no more understand than the Sauron-esque eye of the Oxfordshire synchrotron, where lead palaeontologist Robert DePalma takes his astonishing finds to be scanned. The point is to transport us back to the late Cretaceous so we can see for ourselves how the dinosaursâ€™ last days might have been. And how Attenborough would have looked (like a fish very much in water, naturally) having his chinos sniffed by our cute furry ancestors. Edge-of-your-seat stuff for some, but for me virtual FX in nature/science documentaries tend to induce the disappointment of fake flowers: never as stirring as the real thing. More exciting is the dig at Hell Creek Formation. Here, DePalma and his team are excavating a mass dinosaur graveyard entombed in a layer of crumbly rock. Happily, DePalma has Indiana Jones levels of magnetism, and can unearth a good line with as much class as he wields his trowel (and fedora). â€œItâ€™s like trying to defuse a nuclear weapon while youâ€™re in a rainstorm,â€<9d> he drawls, brushing the mass death layer. While â€œperforming surgery on a Cretaceous fishâ€<9d>, he discovers tiny balls of molten rock in the fishâ€™s gill bars. They are ejector spherules propelled into the atmosphere by the asteroid, which â€œlast saw the light of day when they were flying through the air 66 million years agoâ€<9d>. In a knot of amber, he finds spherules containing a perfectly preserved particle â€œof the bullet that killed the dinosaursâ€<9d>. The asteroid itself. Wow. In another thrilling moment of this detective story set in deep time, the team uncover what has never before been found: the body of a dinosaur killed by the effects of the asteroidâ€™s impact. â€œI think we got ourselves a dinosaur!â€<9d> DePalma cries as they dig a square of sediment that, to me, looks like any other square of sediment. Hours later, the fossilised leg of a thescelosaurus, skin and tissue included, emerges, looking â€œlike a Thanksgiving turkeyâ€<9d>. The legâ€™s location, entangled in the â€œlog jamâ€<9d> of Tanisâ€™s mass death layer, which is where they found the meteorite-flecked amber and spherules, is proof enough. The dinosaur died as a result of the asteroid collision. After that Earth-shattering day, sulphur ejected by the asteroid blocked all sunlight. The planet was plunged into semi-darkness for a decade. Temperatures dropped dramatically. On land, the plants died and in the seas the plankton vanished. Three quarters of all species were wiped out. â€œThen,â€<9d> says Attenborough, â€œcame something wonderful.â€<9d> Plant life returned, and with it, some of the smallest and most resourceful creatures, including our little furry ancestors who had survived the nuclear winter in their burrows. And Attenborough hasnâ€™t given up, either. â€œWe are unique in our ability to learn from the distant past,â€<9d> he concludes. â€œNow we must use that ability wisely â€¦ to protect the millions of species for whom, alongside us, this planet is home.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

Sexiness is the glue that binds the film and provides the connective tissue between its disparate scenes and its cast of characters. The movie lives in the jittery longing of before-sex, the woozy residue of after-sex, the urgency of during-sex. People here have a lot of sex, and the older non-sex-having people (a dad, a grandma) are mostly absent, though the dad actually is having sex (off camera). But when the sex is withdrawn, it leaves behind a sadness and a resentment that the film leaves mostly unsaid. Les Olympiades is the name of the high-rise apartment blocks in the 13th arrondissement of Paris where the action is mostly located â€“ and the film is shot in an unsentimental black-and-white that never makes the city look beautiful in any nouvelle vague style. It is adapted from some stories in the 2015 collection Killing and Dying by the American comic-book artist Adrian Tomine and transplanted from the US to France. It may be that Audiardâ€™s film does not deliver quite the sweetness and empathy for which Tomineâ€™s stories were admired, but there is tremendous fluency and visual charge in his film-making; he gets strongly engaged performances from his cast, and his storytelling has gusto. Audiard also unselfconsciously carries off that mysterious joined-up world effect of a character from one story showing up in another: the discreet sprinkling of happenstance and coincidence that occurs throughout the film. Lucie Zhang plays Ã‰milie, a sharp-tongued young woman living rent-free in an apartment belonging to her grandma, who is now in a care home suffering from dementia. Ã‰milie is looking for a flatmate to provide her with some unearned income, because she senses (correctly) she is about to be fired from her call-centre job for being rude to the customers. This is Camille (Makita Samba), a high-school teacher, who is about to quit his own job to work on his doctoral thesis. They have sex â€“ he is hugely turned on by the Saran wrap she has put around her stomach to lose weight â€“ but he hurts her feelings by airily declaring he wants not to be a couple with her, merely a roommate-with-benefits. Camilleâ€™s own destiny is to link with that of Nora (NoÃ©mie Merlant), a thirtysomething woman who has come to Paris to avoid a toxically coercive relationship in her home town and enrol as a mature student. But when she wears a peroxide wig to a party, Nora is mistaken for â€œAmber Sweetâ€<9d> (Jehnny Beth), an online sex-chat worker; and, after being noisomely bullied, Nora turns to Amber Sweet herself for help, and their relationship begins to flower. Relationships and how we treat people are the keynote themes â€“ and maybe my favourite moment comes when Camille makes a family visit to see his recently widowed father (Pol White) and his 16-year-old sister Eponine (Camille LÃ©on-Fucien) who tells him she now intends to be a standup comic and what does he think? Camille instantly delivers a fantastically supercilious monologue about how he despises comedy. Poor Eponine tearfully storms off to her bedroom; Camille haughtily shrugs and with an air of fearless integrity says that she asked for his opinion. His dad is incredulous: â€œNo one gives a fuck what you think!â€<9d> he rages, adding that all Camille had to do was show a little support. And itâ€™s true. Opinions are changeable and negligible: the need to show tact, kindness and love is constant. Iâ€™m not sure that Les Olympiades says anything too profound about any of its cast of characters, but Audiard achieves something very watchable and entertaining in anthologising them. This is a connoisseur date movie. â€¢ Paris, 13th District screened at the Cannes film festival and is released on 18 March in the UK in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

Shortly before 6pm in Melbourne on Friday, Australiaâ€™s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, exercised a personal power to revoke Djokovicâ€™s visa â€œon health and good order grounds â€¦ and on the basis that it was in the public interest to do soâ€<9d>. It later emerged that one reason why the government wants the menâ€™s world No 1 deported is because they believe his presence could â€œexcite anti-vaccination sentimentâ€<9d>. However the Serbâ€™s legal team said that this was â€œpatently irrationalâ€<9d> and immediately applied for an urgent court directions hearing which began less than three hours after Hawkeâ€™s decision. Shortly after 11pm, after yet more legal arguments in front of Judge Anthony Kelly, it was finally confirmed that Djokovic would be granted a temporary permission to stay â€“ at least until his expedited case is heard in federal court on Sunday. Before then, Djokovic will also meet immigration lawyers on Saturday at 8am. There is a small chance he could leave Australia after that, however on Friday it appeared far more likely that he would stay and fight. According to Prof Jack Anderson, the director of sports law at the University of Melbourne, the chances of Djokovic succeeding are small. â€œAll the Australian government has to do is show that it acted reasonably and rationally, while Djokovicâ€™s team have a very narrow judicial review application to make,â€<9d> he told the Guardian. â€œThey will try to find a way to argue that elements of the ministerâ€™s decision are not reasonable â€“ and, in fact, are so irrational that it should be quashed and Djokovicâ€™s visa reinstated.â€<9d> â€œLooking at judicial reviews of migration cases in Australia generally, you would expect the government will survive this one,â€<9d> he added. â€œAlthough weâ€™ve never quite had an application like this.â€<9d> Certainly the stakes are high. The fresh decision to cancel the visa threatens to leave the Australian Open without one of its biggest stars and Djokovic â€“ who was seeking a record-breaking 21st grand slam triumph in the menâ€™s game â€“ unable to defend the title he has won nine times. It also means the 34-year-old could be effectively barred from re-entering the country for three years unless he can show in future bids that compelling circumstances exist, such as compassionate or Australian national interest grounds. Earlier, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said that Australians had â€œmade many sacrifices during this pandemic, and they rightly expect the result of those sacrifices to be protectedâ€<9d>. â€œThis is what the minister is doing in taking this action today,â€<9d> Morrison said, explaining he would not comment further â€œdue to the expected ongoing legal proceedingsâ€<9d>. However, at an urgent court directions hearing on Friday evening, Djokovicâ€™s counsel, Nicholas Wood, revealed that Djokovicâ€™s visa had been partly revoked because the government believed he would excite anti-vax sentiment. Wood noted that this was â€œradically differentâ€<9d> from the reason for the first cancellation and argued there was â€œno rational basisâ€<9d> for the conclusion. Although Djokovic is not vaccinated, he has not actively promoted anti-vax disinformation. However, Australian anti-vaxxers have been using the hashtag #IStandWithDjokovic on social media. Wood also expressed concern at Djokovicâ€™s safety and a potential â€œmedia circusâ€<9d> when his client is due to be taken into detention after an interview with immigration officials. Meanwhile speaking after his semi-final victory in the Sydney Tennis Classic, Andy Murray described Djokovicâ€™s visa saga as â€œnot great for tennis, not great for the Australian Open, not great for Novakâ€<9d>. â€œIâ€™m not going to sit here and start kicking Novak whilst heâ€™s down,â€<9d> Murray said. â€œI just want it to get resolved. It would be good for everyone if that was the case.â€<9d> The Djokovic saga began when he was detained after arriving in the country on the evening of 5 January. The world No 1 had believed that a visa granted on 18 November and an exemption approved by Tennis Australiaâ€™s chief medical officer and a Victorian government independent expert panel would be sufficient to enter Australia. However, he was then told that a recent Covid infection by itself was not sufficient for an exemption from Australiaâ€™s strict vaccination requirements and that he posed a risk to public health. After four days in an immigration hotel, a federal circuit court judge restored Djokovicâ€™s visa on Monday, concluding it was unreasonable for the Australian Border Force to renege on a deal to give him more time at the airport to address the exemption issue. Since then it has also emerged that Djokovic made several public appearances after his positive Covid diagnosis of 16 December and that he travelled from Serbia to Spain over Christmas before flying to Melbourne â€“ despite declaring on his visa he had not travelled in the two weeks before his flight to Australia. Der Spiegel also claimed anomalies suggested the positive result could have been negative or dated 26 December. On Wednesday, Djokovic conceded his agent made an â€œadministrative mistakeâ€<9d> when declaring he had not travelled in the two weeks before his flight to Australia and acknowledged an â€œerror of judgmentâ€<9d> by not isolating after he tested positive for Covid. However, opinion in Australia has since turned sharply against him. A survey of 60,000 people carried out by NewsCorp before Hawkeâ€™s decision showed that 83% wanted Djokovic to be deported.",FALSE,"pillar/sport","Sport"

The ascending one-bar phrase â€œOh Iâ€<9d> from Ed Sheeranâ€™s Shape of You became the focus of a plagiarism row that threw into question the very art of songwriting itself. Over the course of an 11-day trial, Sheeran and his co-writers, John McDaid and Steve McCutcheon, faced accusations that they had ripped off the 2015 song Oh Why by the grime singer Sami Chokri and songwriter Ross Oâ€™Donoghue. Central to Sheeranâ€™s defence was his argument that the segment in question was â€œa basic minor pentatonic patternâ€<9d>, which is â€œentirely commonplaceâ€<9d>. The superstar even took the stand to hum musical scales from Blackstreetâ€™s No Diggity and Nina Simoneâ€™s classic Feeling Good to demonstrate how common the melody of Shape of You was. The argument convinced Justice Zacaroli, who ruled that Sheeran had â€œneither deliberately or subconsciouslyâ€<9d> ripped off Chokriâ€™s song. But the case showed how difficult it is to differentiate between coincidence, inspiration and theft, especially when our music consumption has changed with the evolution of streaming. In an age of YouTube and Spotify, how do we know if one artist heard another artistâ€™s song, especially if they are relatively unknown, or if they both had the same idea? â€œThe judgment is an emphatic vindication of the creative genius of Ed, Johnny and Steve,â€<9d> said Sheeranâ€™s lawyers on Wednesday. â€œAs they have always maintained, they created Shape of You together, without copying from anyone else.â€<9d> But the debate over copyright infringement in pop continues to rage, as a surge of lawsuits against some of the worldâ€™s biggest pop stars are brought to court. The most significant, experts agree, was the 2018 lawsuit in which Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were found guilty of copying â€œthe feelâ€<9d> of Marvin Gayeâ€™s song Got to Give It Up and ordered to pay $5m (Â£3.8m) to Gayeâ€™s family and future royalties. â€œThe kind of borrowing that was at the heart of the Blurred Lines case has generally not been found to be a copyright violation in the past,â€<9d> said Dr Tim Hughes, a senior lecturer in music at the University of West London. â€œBlurred Lines is an example of what might be called a pastiche: a song consciously written in the style of another. Musical history is full of examples of that practice (although generally not so blatant). But the publicity and the damages awarded in that case were so extreme that it has clearly helped encourage further lawsuits.â€<9d> Other recent litigations include two against Dua Lipa over her song Levitating, one against Katy Perry over her song Dark Horse, and one against Taylor Swift over her 2014 hit Shake It Off by two songwriters who claim she lifted their phrases. Sheeran himself settled a $20m plagiarism lawsuit for his song Photograph in 2017, after he was accused of copying former X Factor winner Matt Cardleâ€™s Amazing. Olivia Rodrigo added two members of Paramore to the writing credits of her hit single Good 4 U, after fans noted similarities to Paramoreâ€™s Misery Business. Sheâ€™s also been accused of copying the riff from Elvis Costelloâ€™s Pump It Up in her song Brutal. But as Costello noted when he came to her defence, this is part and parcel of the process of making music. â€œItâ€™s how rock &amp; roll works,â€<9d> he said. â€œYou take the broken pieces of another thrill and make a brand new toy. Thatâ€™s what I did.â€<9d> According to Joe Bennett, a forensic musicologist at Berklee College Of Music in the US, â€œopportunistic plaintiffsâ€<9d> are exploiting a common musical error that listeners can make, which is to assume that plagiarism is the only explanation for one melody being slightly similar to another. â€œThere are 60,000 songs uploaded to Spotify every day, with more than 82m recordings in the catalogue,â€<9d> Bennett said. â€œRight now, weâ€™re in an era of mainstream pop where a lot of songs are based on two- and four-bar chord loops â€¦ So once in a while a short coincidental similarity occurs, and the plaintiffs are so struck by the similarity that they believe the only explanation must be plagiarism. They are often mistaken.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

His death in 2000 attracted no obituaries and his 1973 LP Traditional and Folk Songs of Yugoslavia remained unsung. Mataja had lived under the radar, a musician seemingly playing only for himself. Now, almost half a century later, his music is finally being reissued and it is causing quite a stir. â€œWhat Branko did was unlike what anyone else was doing at the time,â€<9d> says David Jerkovich, a 43-year-old American musician who is the force getting Matajaâ€™s music heard. â€œHis playing has this kind of outsider, intense quality and itâ€™s just so unique to him. And his studio technique is incredible â€“ he bounced and overdubbed sound in a manner no one else even approached.â€<9d> Jerkovich was cratedigging in a Hollywood used record store in 2005 when he came across a copy of Traditional and Folk Songs of Yugoslavia, priced at $7. â€œHe just looked so badass on the cover that I had to buy it,â€<9d> Jerkovich says. â€œI was buying Yugoslav-era music as my parents are from Croatia â€“ Iâ€™m a first-generation American â€“ and I was wanting to gain a greater understanding of their musical roots. I got home and put it on the stereo and â€¦â€<9d> He pauses, then says: â€œItâ€™s unlike anything Iâ€™d ever heard before. What Branko has done is take these ancient melodies and built something very abstract, very beautiful, out of them.â€<9d> Traditional and Folk Songs of Yugoslavia was released on a tiny label; Jerkovich thinks it was likely a self-financed release. This and recordings Mataja issued on cassette a decade later are gathered on the new compilation Over Fields and Mountains, an album of sublime, spooky beauty: ambient electric guitar soundscapes that bear comparison to what John Fahey, Robbie Basho, John Renbourn and even Dick Dale achieved, having incorporated melodies and tunings from folk, blues, Indian and Arabic music. Jerkovich also emphasises that Matajaâ€™s experiments with tape delay and overdub techniques are groundbreaking and akin to what Lee â€œScratchâ€<9d> Perry and Brian Eno would later develop. â€œHe layered all these different sounds he was creating on a four-track recorder with remarkable skill and imagination,â€<9d> notes Jerkovich. â€œI find Brankoâ€™s music a little psychedelic, even though I know that wasnâ€™t his scene.â€<9d> Who, Jerkovich found himself asking, was this mysterious musician? Mataja (1923-2000) was born in the small coastal town of Bekar, then part of Dalmatia, now Croatia, before his family relocated to Belgrade. It was here 10-year-old Branko built his first guitar. During the second world war, Axis forces occupied Yugoslavia and the teenager was forcibly conscripted to Germany to work as slave labour. After American soldiers liberated the concentration camp he was held in, Branko hustled for the US army as a cook, barber, and pedlar of cigarettes, candy and nylons. He also played guitar in bars US soldiers frequented. Finding the US quota for refugees full and wary of returning to Yugoslavia, Mataja was accepted as a refugee by the UK: he initially lived in a displaced persons camp in Yorkshire. Here he met and married a Montenegrin refugee, Roksanda Radonjic. The Matajas became British citizens before emigrating to Canada in 1954, then in 1963 to Detroit, finally settling in Los Angeles in 1964. As long hair became fashionable and barbers struggled, Mataja was determined to focus on his first love: working on guitars. He spent long hours in his workshop, and having taught himself electrical engineering and built a home studio he began recording himself. The only time he left his workshop for any amount of time was, apparently, to watch the World Cup. He had a son, Bata, who grew up to be a successful businessman supplying customised cars to the film industry. â€œBranko could be seen to have lived the proverbial American dream,â€<9d> Jerkovich says. â€œDad loved to share his music,â€<9d> says Bata. â€œIf people came around the house he would play for them and theyâ€™d go â€˜wowâ€™. But what he played was popular songs of the 1940s â€“ Nat King Cole, Django Reinhardt, that kind of music. Iâ€™m surprised he recorded these old Balkan songs because I donâ€™t recall him playing such.â€<9d> Bata also admits to being surprised when Jerkovich and his friend Doug Mcgowan tracked him down and declared themselves enamoured with his late fatherâ€™s music. Mcgowan works for Numero Group, a US specialist reissue label, but Bata refused his entreaties to license Brankoâ€™s recordings. â€œBata was busy with his own business,â€<9d> says Jerkovich, â€œand didnâ€™t see the point in us reissuing Brankoâ€™s music. He did give us what turned out to be Brankoâ€™s second album, Folk Songs of Serbia â€“ which he had self-released on cassette in the mid-1980s and we had no idea of â€“ and informed us about his fatherâ€™s life, but it took 13 years before he finally came around.â€<9d> Having retired, Bata finally relented and Jerkovich, who runs an LA recording studio, salvaged the now damaged master tapes. It is unlikely we will ever understand why Mataja radically re-contextualised the songs of his childhood; he never returned to Yugoslavia and had no interest in the sectarian divisions that shattered the nation. â€œMaybe he was trying to connect with his mother,â€<9d> Bata suggests; Jerkovich wonders if Mataja was trying to forge a sonic connection with a land he was torn away from as a teenager. The haunted atmospheres his music conjures allow for all kinds of interpretations. Mataja was, says Bata, â€œvery stubborn and determined, always experimenting, inventing things. And pretty intense.â€<9d> Music was his fatherâ€™s great love but, Bata observes, â€œhe never thought of it as something that would make him wealthy. He just loved to make music. He was always inventing things and experimenting â€“ he was like a mad scientist in his studio â€“ and when he was playing guitar, he was in another world.â€<9d> Visitors to his workshop might be given an LP or cassette â€“ that was the extent of his promo. Ill health forced Mataja to stop playing guitar in the 1990s, and, depressed, he died of a heart attack in 2000. He could easily have remained unknown had a young musician not paid $7 for Brankoâ€™s LP in a Hollywood used record store. â€œLuckily they were persistent,â€<9d> Bata says of Jerkovich and Mcgowan. â€œI now wish Iâ€™d done it earlier because when I hear people saying how much Dadâ€™s music means â€“ well, itâ€™s very moving. I only wish Dad was alive so he could experience all the interest and enthusiasm. He told me â€˜music is beautiful â€“ it will open doors for you that you didnâ€™t think will openâ€™. And he was right!â€<9d> â€¢ Over Fields and Mountains is out now on Numero Group.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

Over a three-day hearing this week, the disability royal commission is investigating the troubled Disability Employment Services program, a $1.4bn a year federal government scheme that pays companies and non-profits to get hundreds of thousands of people with disability into work. On Wednesday, counsel assisting the commission, Kate Eastman SC, raised the case of BusyBeans, a barista training course for people with disability run by health services company Rehab Management and a connected employment service provider, AimBig. Despite a significant flow of taxpayer funds, the inquiry heard allegations at least one of the several BusyBeans training centres had â€œno established policies, procedures, safety measures or proper facilities to train the participantsâ€<9d>. It also heard claims participants were referred to the training from its other employment services program, likely triggering a payment from the government for getting the person into work or training. Representatives from AimBig, Rehab Management and their holding company, Arriba Group, are yet to respond and will give evidence later this week. Mzia* is a former jobseeker in the disability employment services program who lives with ADHD. She had been working in retail since she was 14, and had experience as a barista, but no formal qualifications. She told the royal commission she found a job advertisement for a barista trainer and asked her AimBig consultant for help applying, only to learn the BusyBeans program was effectively run by the same company. Despite saying she found the job herself, she said she was asked to sign documents saying her employment consultant had found her the position. Mzia said she had high hopes for the new job, but these were not matched by the reality. Mzia claimed on her first day in May, 2019, she arrived to find the only equipment was a home coffee machine and a bottle of long life milk. She alleged that when she complained about the provisions, she was initially given a Coles petrol voucher to buy â€œproper milk, a jug and bucketâ€<9d>, before being told to buy the equipment herself, and she would be reimbursed. She says she felt forced to obtain an advance Centrelink payment to buy some of the equipment necessary for her work and there was no induction or training on the first day. She alleges she had to create the entire training program from scratch. â€œI thought it would be a lot more set up, a lot more supplies, like basic requirements,â€<9d> she said. Throughout this period, Mzia was still receiving job advice from her AimBig consultant, which she believed was a â€œconflict of interestâ€<9d>. She says she was asked to assess AimBigâ€™s jobseekers to see if they were suitable for BusyBeans. The inquiry heard Mziaâ€™s own employment consultant would put participants from the disability employment services forward for BusyBeans. â€œSometimes you decided that the participants [the consultant] put forward for the program were not suitable, or there was not enough space in the program, but you felt that [the consultant] was bullying and intimidating you,â€<9d> Eastman said, summarising her statement to the inquiry. The inquiry heard the program began in March 2019 and had 167 paid participants and 38 unpaid work experience participants a year later, when it was suspended due to Covid. The inquiry heard AimBig received $874,832 in payments from the federal government for BusyBeans participants. Another company, TLH, received $111,000 in wage subsidies from AimBig as part of the program, the hearing was told. Mzia said she was never given training specific to working with people with disability or an adequate position description. She resigned in March 2020 after a period of sick leave due to the stress of the job between October 2019 and January 2020. She had been initially classified as having a â€œbenchmarkâ€<9d> of working 15 hours per week due to her disability, but had been working 30 hours a week with BusyBeans, initially at $25 an hour, though this was later increased to $30 per hour. Mzia said she started trying to find her students employment in hospitality, telling the commission: â€œI felt I had to do something because no one else was helping the participants.â€<9d> Participants were supposed to be making coffee for Rehab Management staff, but the inquiry heard there were not enough employees so the jobseekers would be â€œstuck in the office five hours a day, three days a week, just standing in the front of the Breville machineâ€<9d>. Eastman said the inquiry would examine whether â€œAimBig provided adequate and appropriate post placement support to Mziaâ€<9d> and whether there was a conflict between its role as her employment consultant and her employer, among other issues. Last year, Guardian Australia revealed a damning consultantsâ€™ report that discovered myriad problems with the disability employment services program, including that providers were funnelling participants into courses rather than work in order to claim bonus payments.

Nezam Salangy, 44, was found guilty at Worcester crown court of killing 28-year-old Zobaidah Salangy, his wife of eight years, on 28 March 2020 then burying her in woodland near Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, under cover of darkness. Zobaidahâ€™s body was missed by police during an initial search of the area in April 2020 as they failed to dig deep enough, the court heard. As a result of the delay, it was impossible to determine the exact cause of her death, the prosecution said. Salangyâ€™s younger brothers, Mohammed Yasin Salangi, 34, and 31-year-old Mohammed Ramin Salangy, were convicted alongside him of helping to cover up the crime. The younger brother travelled 90 miles by taxi from his and Yasinâ€™s home in Cardiff to help bury the victim. Yasin assisted in the crime by covering up knowledge of the killing and the unmarked burial, proved by telephone evidence. Nezam Salangy later reported his wife missing to police, telling them â€œshe had gone out for a run and never come backâ€<9d>, after leaving him for a â€œnew boyfriendâ€<9d>, prosecutors said. As he left the dock accompanied by security guards, Nezam Salangy stared for several seconds at six West Mercia police detectives who had conducted the investigation, telling them: â€œYou guys framed meâ€<9d>. One of his brothers, as he was led down the stairs to the court cells, said: â€œThatâ€™s the wrong decision.â€<9d> Shortly after the three men were led downstairs, the court security alarm was triggered. None had chosen to give evidence during the trial. During the six-week trial, the court heard that after Nezam Salangy was arrested on 4 April 2020, he told officers he â€œwas confident his wife was still alive and would return homeâ€<9d>. During an initial search of woodland near the Worcestershire village of Lower Bentley, police mistook â€œa hard layer of soil that they reached to be a natural base below which no one would digâ€<9d>, prosecuting barrister Simon Denison QC said. They abandoned the search but, â€œconvinced she must be thereâ€<9d>, returned to the spot in October 2020 and found Zobaidahâ€™s body bound in curtain wire and wrapped in black bin bags and a duvet cover that matched pillow cases found at the coupleâ€™s house in Bromsgrove. The prosecution told jurors that on 27 March, the day before Zobaidahâ€™s disappearance, the couple had â€œargued bitterlyâ€<9d> and that part of the row was video recorded by Nezam Salangy on his phone. In the recording, both said â€œthat their relationship was overâ€<9d>. The prosecuting barrister, Simon Denison QC, said â€œZobaidah Salangy vanished off the face of the earthâ€<9d> the next day. Jurors heard Zobaidah had been a maths teacher in Afghanistan and that her November 2012 nuptials to Nezam Salangy, then already living in the UK, had been an arranged marriage. She moved to the UK in October 2013 to live with Nezam Salangy, and was attending English classes at a night school twice a week, intending to either resume maths teaching or become a midwife. Nezam Salangy, Yasin Salangi and Ramin Salangy will be sentenced in June.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

There is no question about that at the beginning of the year when the Winter Olympics are taking place in Beijing and the World Cup in Qatar. You only have to open the newspaper these days. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the Guardian, the Polish Gazeta Wyborcza and other quality media, which gather many voices to report on the world, deal on their sports pages with the diplomatic boycott of the Olympics by the USA, Great Britain and other countries, the â€œquiet diplomacyâ€<9d> of the International Olympic Committee and workersâ€™ rights in Qatar. One news item received particular attention worldwide. Out of concern for the life of Peng Shuai, the former world No 1 in doubles, the WTA has suspended all tournaments in China. In total, about 30% of the WTAâ€™s revenue comes from China, with the annual finals in Shenzhen paying out the equivalent of about â‚¬12m (Â£10m), more than any other event in womenâ€™s tennis. But the players are now saying: weâ€™ll do without. Taking a strong stance is a tradition in womenâ€™s tennis, whose history is marked by personalities. In the 1960s, the WTA founder and multiple grand slam winner Billie Jean King campaigned for equal treatment and pay for the genders. Later, the multiple Wimbledon winner Martina Navratilova campaigned for gay rights. The supposedly weaker sex actually dominates the fighting mode. Female athletes have turned their federation into an independent institution. The WTAâ€™s consistent decisions send a signal: you can say no in sport. Negotiations require an interplay â€“ approaching each other, but also withdrawing from time to time. Countries in which human rights are not universal also invest in football. These countries are part of global sport and offer so much money that many find it difficult to refuse. The German television broadcaster ZDF recently ran a hidden-camera investigation. The reporter spoke to workers from Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh who build stadiums and roads in Qatar. Eight of them lived in one room; they earn â‚¬300 a month each but have been waiting months for their salaries. The report also featured attractive match scenes from the 2021 Arab Cup and all eight new stadiums. In a country with 2.9 million inhabitants there are now eight of the most modern, expensive and beautiful stadiums in the world, less than an hourâ€™s drive apart. The ZDF report was in anticipation of the dilemma facing the 2022 World Cup: people know about the situation in Qatar but they enjoy watching the spectacular pictures and the best teams. When the 1978 World Cup took place under the direction of the Argentinian military regime, many players had no answer to questions about human rights. Today, the world can no longer be viewed so naively. Everyone involved knows better than before about what is going on in faraway continents. Most footballers also have more time to deal with such issues, due to advanced professionalisation. Public figures like them are also expected to inform themselves of matters outside their bubble. Now that the world has become a village, everyone knows the conditions in Qatar. Some footballers are stepping in and calling for human rights to be respected. â€œI think more attention needs to be paid to this kind of thing in the future when awarding contracts,â€<9d> the Germany international Leon Goretzka has said. Finlandâ€™s captain, Tim Sparv, wrote in an open letter: â€œWe woke up too late, I woke up too late.â€<9d> Sparv called on players, media and fans to talk about working conditions in Qatar. On a small scale, this argument is already bearing fruit. When a black player was racially insulted by a spectator during the third division match between MSV Duisburg and VfL OsnabrÃ¼ck in Germany in December, the teams forced a stop. All parties quickly agreed that they wanted to set an example: players, both clubs, referees, the association and fans from both camps. The individual is not powerless; people can make a difference. Small is where you start, big is where it can end. Greta Thunberg was 15 when she stood alone on a street in Stockholm to draw attention to climate change. Many joined in, and Fridays for Future has since put the environment on the global agenda. This has changed politics. Football too: the 2024 European Championship in Germany can be judged a success only if it takes ecological aspects into account. Our preparations are under way. I consider myself lucky to have been born into a democracy. It was not long ago that the conditions in my home country were different. Three decades ago Germany was divided, the eastern part a dictatorship. Other nations in Europe were also going through a change. The 1964 European Championship took place in a fascist state, and Spainâ€™s team won its home tournament in front of General Franco. He was still in power when the 1982 World Cup was awarded to Spain. By the time it took place, Spain was a democracy. Major sporting events, especially in football, generate enormous attention. Nowadays, European Championships and World Cups require everyone who takes part to deal with working conditions and human rights. At Euro 2024 in Germany, too, Europe will negotiate with each other how we want to live together. â€¢ Philipp Lahmâ€™s column appears regularly in the Guardian.

As Sells recalls in her new photobook, Hot Damn!: â€œShe looked me up and down and said, â€˜Weâ€™re looking for some help for Hunter. Are you a night owl? Would you be interested?â€™â€<9d> Hunter, as every local knew, was Hunter S Thompson, the celebrated creator of â€œgonzoâ€<9d> journalism, and the townâ€™s most infamous resident. The woman was his wife, Anita. â€œIt took me only a moment,â€<9d> Sells says, â€œto answer â€˜Yesâ€™ to everything.â€<9d> Sells ended up working as Thompsonâ€™s personal assistant for just over a year, doing â€œanything and everything that needed doingâ€<9d>. Her typical working hours were 11pm until dawn, and her tasks included preparing his often elaborate dinners to order (microwave turkey dinner with soup, chutney, peanut butter and salsa), reading his prose back to him while he shouted instructions (â€œLouder, louder, slower, slowerâ€<9d>) and dealing with his increasingly frequent bouts of explosive anger at his publishers, editors, acolytes and the world in general. â€œI was in my late 20s in full rockâ€™nâ€™roll mode, young and bulletproof,â€<9d> she says. â€œIâ€™d grown up in Aspen in a pretty wild, bohemian family and I knew nothing that Hunter did could bother me. In fact, the only thing that got to me was the cigarette smoke. There was so much of it.â€<9d> Sellsâ€™ father had been a hippy in his youth, opening one of Coloradoâ€™s earliest â€œhead shopsâ€<9d> in nearby Boulder, selling drug paraphernalia. Just like Thompson, he had relocated to the mountains in Aspen in the late 60s to escape the pressures of the straight life. In the decades that followed, though, the town became a hangout for the privileged and the famous, drawn by its breathtaking Rocky Mountains, winter sports, libertarian politics and abundant availability of cocaine. â€œYou could trek and ski by day and do shitloads of coke at night,â€<9d> says Sells, laughing. â€œThere were dealers and busts â€“ and mountainsâ€™ worth of cocaine that was regularly flown in on Cessnas.â€<9d> By the 1990s, Aspen had become a realtorâ€™s dream, drawing A-list celebrities including Goldie Hawn and Sylvester Stallone, as well as younger acolytes of Thompsonâ€™s including Johnny Depp, who played his alter ego â€“ Raoul Duke â€“ in the film version of the writerâ€™s most famous book, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. â€œYouâ€™d suddenly see famous people everywhere,â€<9d> says Sells, â€œbut the prevailing attitude in Aspen is not to stare or make a big deal out of it.â€<9d> At Owl Farm, Thompsonâ€™s compound in Woody Creek, she realised early on that her irascible employer demanded not just her unyielding attention, but also constant intellectual stimulation into the early hours. â€œI decided early on never to get wasted with him,â€<9d> she says proudly. â€œI stayed straight throughout my time there. Iâ€™d seen the scorn he reserved for those who turned up to pay homage to him, got completely stoned and started acting stupid. They were never welcomed back.â€<9d> For all his volatile unpredictability, Sells describes Thompson as â€œessentially an old-fashioned southern gentlemanâ€<9d>, whose fits of anger were often immediately followed by heartfelt contrition. Once, having taunted her with the news that Taschen was publishing a book of his photographs, he immediately felt guilty and granted her free rein to photograph the interiors and contents of Owl Farm, the one part of his life that had not been extensively documented. She immediately took him up on his offer. The negatives from that time languished in storage for 10 years, while Sellsâ€™ work moved from straight documentary towards a vividly experimental approach close to pure abstraction â€“ swirls and patterns of colour deftly applied to her landscapes in the darkroom. Something of a bohemian herself, Sells has lived for over 20 years between London and Botswana, where her late husband Peter Sandenbergh ran a safari camp business. Her previous book, Flamingo, was shot on the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans in the desolate heart of the Kalahari Desert. In 2016, Peter died of cancer and, soon after, she found out that she was pregnant from the IVF treatment they had undergone while he was ill. â€œSuddenly, my partner was gone and I was pregnant and trying to figure out what to do and how to be an artist,â€<9d> she says. â€œThatâ€™s when I thought, â€˜Letâ€™s just dust off those old negatives from Aspen.â€™â€<9d> Unsurprisingly, Hot Damn! â€“ which took five years to complete to her satisfaction â€“ is a more hybrid work than her previous series. Sells originally shot Thompsonâ€™s living quarters and possessions in a fly-on-the-wall documentary style that captures all the hovering chaos of a life lived on the edge: his cluttered writing desk, piles of unfinished manuscripts, various stuffed and mounted birds and animals, guns, ephemera from his writing career, his collections of hats and his electric typewriter, plus endless Post-it notes with often extravagant titles â€“ Sodomized at the Airport, Olympic Disaster in Utah, The Wisdom of Nashville and the Violence of Jack Nicholson. Pure gonzo, in fact. More intriguing are the dreamily psychedelic images that punctuate the book, creating a narrative that shifts constantly from the visceral to the woozily disorienting â€“ not unlike, one imagines, day-to-day life in Woody Creek. â€œI donâ€™t make documentary work any more,â€<9d> Sells says, â€œand to be honest, I looked at some of the pictures and thought they were a bit boring. I started using the Japanese and Italian marbling techniques I had studied to push the boundaries a bit. It took a few years before it really started to sing, but I think it offers this emotive quality that gets closer to what the ride was like â€“ the speed, the intensity, the pressure of working with Hunter, but also the strange intimacy. It points to his legacy, but also to the spirit of my own creativity.â€<9d> Much to Thompsonâ€™s annoyance, Sells departed Woody Creek for the last time in January 2005, having decided to travel to Thailand to document the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami. A few weeks later, on 20 February, her father called her to break the news that Thompson had died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. â€œMy legs buckled and I fell to my knees,â€<9d> she says, lapsing into silence for a few moments. â€œItâ€™s not that I didnâ€™t see it coming, because he spoke about it a lot. His health was giving out and he was in constant chronic pain. His body was degenerating and his mind was not as sharp. Basically, he was not having fun. Plus, he had this Hemingway crush.â€<9d> Hemingway had taken his life with a double-barrelled shotgun in 1961. Sells remembers one early-hours conversation, when Thompson told her mysteriously that he had his death taken care of. â€œIn my head, I was thinking, â€˜How is that even possible?â€™ Then a few days later, I was like, â€˜OK, thatâ€™s what was going to happen.â€™ But it never occurred to me it would happen on my watch. That I was so close to it is what was really shocking.â€<9d> How does Sells think back on her time at Woody Creek? â€œWith gratitude,â€<9d> she says. â€œHunter was a handful: he lived to break the rules. That was his thing. But he was also inspiring and invigorating to be around, because he was just so sharp and smart. He would have had serious fun taking down Trump, thatâ€™s for sure. But underneath it all, he was an old school gentleman. He couldnâ€™t help it, even amid all the rants and the bad behaviour. He was someone who would stand up when a lady entered the room.â€<9d> She pauses for a second. â€œThatâ€™s if he was capable of standing up.â€<9d> Hot Damn! by Chloe Sells is published by Gost Books.

The move comes amid support from several Premier League clubs for players affected by Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine. West Hamâ€™s manager David Moyes has given the former Ukraine captain Andriy Yarmolenko time off after the attack on his country, with the winger not in the right frame of mind to play against Wolves on Sunday. â€œHeâ€™s not in a very good position at the moment,â€<9d> Moyes said. â€œWeâ€™ve given him a few days off. Weâ€™ll do all we can to help him â€“ itâ€™s a really difficult time for him and his family. I spoke with him yesterday and he was upset, which you can imagine. We just hope his family keep safe.â€<9d> Two Ukraine internationals could be involved when Everton host the Premier League leaders. The club has sounded an air-raid siren before its traditional Z-Cars theme as a way of galvanising the Goodison crowd in recent seasons but that is likely to be dropped given the situation in Ukraine. Mykolenko, who joined Everton only last month from Dynamo Kyiv, has written on social media about the worry of being unable to help his parents back home. Several Everton supportersâ€™ groups have produced a banner that features the 22-year-old, his countryâ€™s colours and the words â€œWe stand with Ukraineâ€<9d> for Saturdayâ€™s game. Frank Lampard says a decision on whether to select Mykolenko against City will be down to the player. â€œI wouldnâ€™t try to force him into a direction,â€<9d> the Everton manager said. â€œThe decision will be his. The feeling I get is that by coming here and feeling our support in training, it is a small period where his mind is not on other things. That is what it feels like at the minute and Iâ€™ll keep tabs on that day by day. â€œIn terms of us as a club, weâ€™re here to support him in any way we can. He just needs to know we are here for him. How we can help with his family, all we can do at this point is support him. Heâ€™s been good, training well. Training is a mini-escape in terms of what is going on in his head. In tough moments it can help a young lad in a tough position. I know there are many others in tougher positions but he has been fine.â€<9d> Zinchenko, who has captained Ukraine, took part in a vigil outside Manchester Central Library on Thursday along with hundreds of his compatriots. Pep Guardiola said: â€œWhat would you do if someone attacked the UK? How would you react? How would you feel? Itâ€™s what he feels [to protest]. Unfortunately around the world there are many wars â€“ this is a new one. Itâ€™s more than a pity because innocent people are dying when these innocent people just want to live in peace. â€œHe is worried. What would we feel if in our country, where we were born and have family and friends, innocent people are being killed? How will you feel? I guess thatâ€™s what he feels. Of course, the team and the club is close to him, unconditionally.â€<9d> The City manager confirmed the 25-year-old was available for the game at Goodison. â€œOleks is an incredible, strong guy,â€<9d> he said. â€œOf course itâ€™s not easy at the moment but in training yesterday he was brilliant so heâ€™s ready to play in case he has to.â€<9d> Everton, meanwhile, have appointed Kevin Thelwell as their new director of football. The 48-year-old joins from New York Red Bulls, where he was head of sport, and was previously sporting director at Wolves. He replaces Marcel Brands, who left the relegation-threatened club in December.",FALSE,"pillar/sport","Sport"

Ireland. Theyâ€™ve gone quietly about their business, there doesnâ€™t seem to be any great sense of hyperbole about them, but they beat New Zealand in the autumn, are coming strolling into the Six Nations and are red-hot favourites to beat the reigning champions. Predicted order Ireland, England, France, Scotland, Wales, Italy. Key match? The second week is crucial and, while Wales v Scotland could be pivotal, France v Ireland is blockbuster. Franceâ€™s tournament begins for real then but itâ€™s always tight and memories of Johnny Sextonâ€™s late drop goal will still be fresh. Best player? Antoine Dupont may seem the obvious choice but he has not played too much recently and there is no hiding place for him as the world player of the year. Everyone will be looking to put pressure on the most influential player in French rugby. Breakthrough player? A few possibilities â€“ Mack Hansen, the uncapped Ireland wing, could burst on to the scene like Louis Rees-Zammit last year and on the subject of Wales, Johnny McNicholl, Taine Basham and Ellis Jenkins could take the next step up. I canâ€™t wait for â€¦ The chance to see players smiling post-match. Unfortunately it was an enduring image of last yearâ€™s tournament when Rees-Zammit had scored that wonder try against Scotland but had to wear a mask when doing his TV interview. Robert Kitson Who will win? France. Or Ireland. Or maybe Scotland. The championship grows more fiendishly competitive: the only certainty is that a grand slam will be a mighty achievement. Pin me down and Iâ€™ll plump for France on points difference. Predicted order France, Ireland, Scotland, England, Wales, Italy. Key match? There are plenty but France v Ireland in Paris in round two will fundamentally influence the title outcome. Most important player? Johnny Sexton. As long as he stays fit, Ireland will believe they have all angles covered. Breakthrough talent? If Ulsterâ€™s James Hume gets a run he will make opposition centres sit up. I canâ€™t wait for â€¦ Scotland v England. Tension-filled, tumultuous â€“ and thatâ€™s just the weather forecast. A home win in front of a raucous Murrayfield crowd will put the â€œdinâ€<9d> in Edinburgh. Andy Bull Who will win? At their best, France are a cut above every other team. Theyâ€™ll win a grand slam, with one or two nail-biting last-minute victories along the way. Predicted order France, Ireland, Scotland, England, Wales, Italy. Key match? France v Ireland in the second week is the showdown between the two top teams from last autumn and, unlike England and Wales, theyâ€™ve both got (mostly) fit squads to pick from. Most important player? Antoine Dupont, stand-in captain, world player of the year, and a man who can crack open the best defences. Expect him to make the difference in at least one close game. Breakthrough talent? This time last year, Melvyn Jaminet was playing in the French second division. Has landed 92% of his shots at goal and scored 89 points, in six Tests since he made his debut. I canâ€™t wait for â€¦ After the past two years, the first trip out and about among a crowd. The prospect of a wet and windy weekend at Murrayfield never seemed so tantalising. Gerard Meagher Who will win? Ireland. Will need a win in Paris or at Twickenham but their two defeats last year were by fine margins and they have improved significantly since then. Predicted order Ireland, France, England, Scotland, Wales, Italy Key match? England v Ireland. Canâ€™t see a grand slam this year but thereâ€™s every chance both sides will be two wins from three by their round four meeting. The victors will then take some stopping on the final weekend. Most important player? Tadhg Furlong. When he is playing at the top of his game, Ireland tend to be doing similarly. The leading tighthead prop in the northern hemisphere and he has returned to fitness just at the right time. Breakthrough talent? Alex Dombrandt. Has been consistently demonstrating his rich talents at Harlequins for a while and this yearâ€™s competition will be all the better if he can do so for England. I canâ€™t wait for â€¦ South Africa to join the championship. In the meantime, though, this is shaping up to be one of the most unpredictable tournaments in recent memory and with an emphasis on attacking intent it should not disappoint. Michael Aylwin Who will win? Ireland. But any of the top four in my list could finish anywhere, bar sixth. Oh, and then thereâ€™s Wales, who are the actual champions, remember. Ireland will probably lose in Paris or London. Predicted order Ireland, Scotland, England, France, Wales, Italy. Key match France-Ireland. The winner will be two from two and motoring. If France lose, theyâ€™ll probably fall apart. If Ireland win, they host Italy, then go to Twickenham. I think Ireland will win. Most important player Well, this is always a fly-half, isnâ€™t it. Unless youâ€™re being difficult. I already feel as if Iâ€™ve been difficult in tipping French travails (not that there isnâ€™t ample precedent). So Sexton. Obviously. Breakthrough talent This is where you can be difficult, so Iâ€™ll go for Paolo Garbisi of bottom-placed Italy. They have spent decades trying to find a No 10. Now they have one, they need to find a team to go with him. I canâ€™t wait for â€¦ The bleating about the state of modern rugby after the first bad game. Rugby has lots of massive, possibly terminal problems, but the spectacle on the field is better than ever. Do not be fooled by the edited best bits of yesteryear.",FALSE,"pillar/sport","Sport"

In June 2020, in the early months of the pandemic, 68 people were incarcerated in the county past their original trial deadlines, according to data from the public defender. By January 2022, the latest data available, that number had grown to nearly 250. Hundreds more are awaiting trial out of custody. California state law stipulates that those accused of crimes are entitled to a speedy trial â€“ 30 to 60 days after their arraignment, depending on the nature of the crime. But backlogs in the court system, made worse by the pandemic, have obliterated those deadlines, often at significant cost to the mental health and wellbeing of those imprisoned, and their loved ones. The problem in the county became so severe that Mano Raju, the San Francisco public defender, filed a lawsuit in September 2021 alleging the cityâ€™s superior court is violating peopleâ€™s constitutional right to a speedy trial. â€œThese arenâ€™t even people who have been convicted of a crime,â€<9d> Raju said. â€œTheyâ€™re just awaiting their day in court.â€<9d> This disproportionately affects communities of color. Though Black residents comprise 6% of San Franciscoâ€™s total population, they make up about 45% of the county jail population. â€œOur clients are largely poor and from communities of color, so when their rights are trampled there isnâ€™t always the outcry there would be if this was happening to people from another community,â€<9d> said Raju. Robert Brewer, who was held for more than five months past his original trial date, said the long wait showed the criminal justice systemâ€™s unfairness. It has taken a toll on his health and put his life on hold. â€œYouâ€™re supposed to be innocent until proven guilty, but youâ€™re treated as if youâ€™ve already been sentenced,â€<9d> he said. Brewer was found not guilty of a homicide charge in May 2021 following a trial, but since his release, the experience of incarceration has continued to affect his mental health. â€œBeing released is not as joyful as you might expect,â€<9d> Brewer said. â€œYou come out of this hole with very little human contact. You make it out, but you leave a big piece of yourself in jail.â€<9d> In his lawsuit, Raju points to the lingering effects of case backlogs on individualsâ€™ mental health and the county jailâ€™s treatment of incarcerated people during Covid-19 lockdowns to argue the court should do more to address the backlogs. Some people who have been incarcerated told the Guardian they were allowed out of their cells for less than an hour a day during outbreaks of the virus. The public defenderâ€™s office has worked closely with other organizations to improve conditions at the jail for residents. Brewer said he was only allowed to shower every two to three days before returning to his cell, after a cellmate contracted Covid. Solitary confinement and social isolation have been strongly linked to negative impacts on mental health, including a heightened risk of suicide. The San Francisco sheriffâ€™s department, which manages the jail, said it followed practices recommended by health officials in keeping custody officers and jail residents safe. The department acknowledged incarcerated people were sometimes held in their cells for upwards of 23 hours a day, citing a variety of reasons such as â€œsocial distancing protocols, quarantine protocols, isolation protocols, disciplinary action, administrative segregation, and staffing shortagesâ€<9d>. Raju said: â€œSolitary-like conditions mean you canâ€™t leave a cell, often one where you can reach out your arms and touch the walls, for more than one hour per day. This can have a strong psychological impact.â€<9d> Kwixuan Maloof, a San Francisco deputy public defender, says that a trial deadline can serve as a source of stability and encourages people to resist the temptation to accept a plea bargain, which often involves pleading guilty and avoiding a trial in exchange for the possibility of more lenient sentencing or a charge being downgraded. But without that guarantee, the pressure to accept a bargain goes up, even for those who believe they have a strong chance of being exonerated in court. â€œItâ€™s very frustrating for me, and 10 times more so for my clients, when they ask me when their trial is going to start and all I can say is â€˜I donâ€™t know,â€™â€<9d> said Maloof. â€œIn those circumstances, it becomes very easy to say: â€˜You know what, Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m going to take whatever deal they offer me.â€™â€<9d> â€˜I can hear the light leaving my sonâ€™ Before the pandemic, court backlogs were far from unheard of in the US. But an August 2021 study by the Thomson Reuters Institute found that the pandemic had substantially increased such backlogs nationwide, as trials were indefinitely delayed during surges of the virus and courts struggled to adapt to virtual operations. According to the judicial council of California, the clearance rate for criminal trials statewide has dropped by around 20% during the pandemic. As restrictions start to ease, success at alleviating the backlogs has been mixed as different municipalities experiment with varying approaches. Matt Malone, a public information officer with the Contra Costa county superior court, said that through a number of initiatives, the court had brought its case backlog from 104 in March 2021 to 51 in March 2022. If not for the suspension of jury trials during the Omicron surge, Malone notes, the backlog would probably have been even lower. Malone added the county had taken steps to adapt to social distancing requirements, such as making sure remote capabilities were â€œtremendously expandedâ€<9d>, staggering jury calls, and installing air filtration systems in courtrooms. Rose Marie Sims, a plaintiff in the legal action filed by Raju against the San Francisco superior court, said her son Christopher had been incarcerated for more than two years and still had not received a trial. â€œI canâ€™t believe this is America. I love this country, but the judicial system seems to have lost its mind,â€<9d> said Sims. â€œHow do you keep someone locked up like that without giving them their trial? Every time I talk with my son on the phone, I can hear the light leaving him.â€<9d> Sims said her son had lost his fiancee and job and would need to start over. â€œHeâ€™s lost everything,â€<9d> she said. â€œItâ€™s traumatizing as a parent.â€<9d> The public defenderâ€™s office, as well as the San Francisco district attorney, have called on the San Francisco superior court to make more rooms available for criminal trials in the civic center courthouse. In February of this year, Raju filed a petition in the California courts of appeal asking that the San Francisco court be forced to take steps to prioritize criminal trials. The Contra Costa county superior court, where Raju filed his original lawsuit in September, had concluded it did not have authority over the San Francisco superior court. A spokesperson for San Francisco superior court said the court was committed to justice and â€œprocessing all cases as expeditiously as possible under the difficult circumstances presented by the pandemicâ€<9d>. But Raju disagrees and said more needed to be done to process cases swiftly. â€œHow long it will take to address the backlog depends on what the court is willing to do,â€<9d> he said. â€œThere is a lack of urgency.â€<9d> In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is at 800-273-8255 and online chat is also available.

The CCCâ€™s acting chair, Bruce Barbour, said the increase, which resulted in 1,426 complaints in total, was linked to â€œpositive actionâ€<9d> taken to review the handling of domestic violence investigations and the â€œfailure of police staff to comply with the commissionerâ€™s direction regarding Covid-19 vaccine and workplace health and safetyâ€<9d>. Barbour spoke of the figures during a hearing of the parliamentary Crime and Corruption Committee regarding the CCCâ€™s activities from January to the end of March. Opposition MPs used Tuesdayâ€™s hearing to continue the LNPs push for the equivalent of a royal commission into what it describes as the stateâ€™s â€œintegrity crisisâ€<9d>. Pressed on whether the CCC could deliver such a probe, Barbour said that the watchdog â€œdoesnâ€™t have a general or broad remit to do wide ranging inquiriesâ€<9d> and that even if such an inquiry did fall within its jurisdiction, the CCC would require additional government funding. Queenslandâ€™s integrity commissioner, Dr Nikola Stepanov, has also backed a commission of inquiry into a â€œmultitude of integrity-related issuesâ€<9d> involving the government and public service that would have the legal powers and protections of a royal commission. Stepanov â€“ whose office regulates lobbying in Queensland â€“ has previously raised concerns about interference with her office by the Public Service Commission (PSC), which controls her agencyâ€™s budget and staffing. Those concerns include allegations the PSC removed and wiped the contents of a laptop used by an employee, and complaints that the PSC had gradually stripped resources and key staff from the integrity commissionerâ€™s office. Barbour said that the CCC had recently finished a draft report investigating those allegations, dubbed â€œOperation Workshopâ€<9d>, which he anticipated would be completed over coming weeks before moving on to the procedural fairness stage. Barbour also used the hearing to trumpet the bodyâ€™s success in busting organised crime, highlighting a 13-month investigation which culminated last Friday in a sting which seized 9kg of methamphetamine â€“ estimated to have a street value of approximately $1.73m â€“ â€œsubstantial sums of cashâ€<9d> and the arrest of a 37-year-old man. The Queensland police union last year called on the CCC to be stripped of its responsibilities for investigating major and organised crime, with civil libertarians also raising concerns that the CCC had become â€œa super police forceâ€<9d> and that this role has overshadowed its function as a corruption watchdog. Barbour has been acting CCC chair since Alan MacSporran resigned from the role in January, seven weeks after a parliamentary committee found he failed in his duty to ensure the watchdog â€œacted independently and impartiallyâ€<9d>.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Record Store Day brings an EP with previously unreleased tracks, and on 22 April, they commence the UK leg of their Against the Odds tour with special guest Johnny Marr. To tee up Blondieâ€™s big year, Debbie Harry will be taking your questions for the Guardian Film &amp; Music reader interview. Anyone who has read her fantastic 2019 memoir, Face It, knows thereâ€™s no shortage of things to ask about: her status as one of the artists who defined punk and new wave; Blondieâ€™s trailblazing social milieu in New York, including Andy Warhol; surviving the music business and the taxman; how she has maintained her uniquely resilient spirit and defied the nostalgia machine to remain creatively committed into her 70s. Post your questions about Harryâ€™s long career in the comments below by noon GMT on Monday 28 February. Her answers will be published in the 4 March edition of the Guardianâ€™s Film &amp; Music section, and online. â€¢ Blondieâ€™s Against the Odds UK tour with special guest Johnny Marr runs from 22 April to 7 May.

For some the pilgrimages to Europeâ€™s great capitals alongside old friends are the biggest draw, with the match itself a mere bonus. For others it is just as special in their local pub or at home with their extended family. It is this annual wave of communal joy that distinguishes the championship from all the other televisual wallpaper out there. Every now and again, though, the planets align and the quality of the actual games overtakes all else. This year could be one of those classic examples. Consider the runners and riders. Weather permitting, France, Ireland, Scotland and England are all hoping to pose a sharper attacking threat than 12 months ago with Wales, as defending champions, unlikely to retreat into their shells either. A tournament for the ages, consequently, is a possibility. France have their deepest, most exciting squad in years. Ireland have also just come off an autumn triumph over New Zealand and have some impressive new talent. Scotland, it is generally agreed, have not been better placed in the professional era. England are short of some familiar names but retain mighty ambitions. And last season Wales registered more tries than they have ever scored in a Six Nations campaign. Even Italy are perking up at age-group level, with happier days hopefully ahead. Hence why the 2022 Six Nations is the subject of even greater anticipation than usual. Memories of last yearâ€™s fizzing edition remain fresh and, unlike 12 months ago, supporters are back to reboot the tournamentâ€™s soul. Even more crucially, the game is changing, with less emphasis on attrition and more on proactive intent. Ruck speed is now the buzz tactical phrase on everyoneâ€™s lips. With referees likely to be hotter than ever on teams looking to slow the ball down illegally, it explains why every side has been recalibrating their approach. There was a time, for example, when Ireland simply preferred vice-like efficiency, squeezing and pressurising their opponents and giving them nothing. Increasingly â€“ and credit to Andy Farrell for encouraging it â€“ they want to up the tempo and create more themselves. If Leinster are any guide, they will also be fit enough to make it happen. Will it be Johnny Sextonâ€™s last stand? You suspect the 36-year-old will be desperate to make it count either way. The evocative documentary about Irelandâ€™s great out-halves which aired on Sunday night was a timely reminder of the fine traditions of the green No 10 shirt, from Jackie Kyle and Ollie Campbell to Tony Ward and Ronan Oâ€™Gara, and Sextonâ€™s desire still runs as deep as any of them. Along with the most seasoned tactician, the Irish also have the best scrum in the competition. They still, even so, have to go to Paris and London and win. Tick those boxes and a grand slam would surely follow. Slightly more likely is a see-sawing scramble and a three-way title race entering the final straight. Luck will play some part but so will old-fashioned endeavour. Yes, Wales scored plenty of tries but despite finishing bottom of the class for metres made, carries and defenders beaten they still became champions courtesy of a solid scrum and lineout and making more tackles than anyone else. Which is why, above and beyond the specific names on the team sheet, this seasonâ€™s winners will be the team able to strike the best balance between ambition and the accuracy of their basics. There is now an even greater onus on teams to threaten off first phase and no shortage of magicians â€“ Finn Russell, Marcus Smith, Romain Ntamack â€“ to conjure something gloriously unexpected. Remember Ntamackâ€™s break out from behind his own line against the All Blacks in the autumn? Expect more of it, because teams are realising that striking hard and fast against flat-footed opponents can yield more reward than plodding through 25-plus phases. The 50:22 rule also helps and getting held up over the try line also no longer means an attacking five-metre scrum. It makes smart cross-kicks or quick-witted taps ever more valuable. In that regard, France have the best scrum-half in the world and some of the most lethal finishers. All that is now stopping Les Bleus from becoming an absolute global powerhouse is themselves: inner confidence is very often the difference between a decent side and a great one. Between them, though, Shaun Edwards, RaphaÃ«l IbaÃ±ez and Fabien GalthiÃ© know what a winning culture looks like. France will finish in the top two at least. Poor old injury-hit England? In the end it is less about who plays as how they play. When he axed several of his Saracens stalwarts, Eddie Jones was not only distancing himself from them as individuals but as a collective philosophy. Now the aim is to take the game to the opposition more urgently, with attack coach Martin Gleeson having made a visible difference. If Smith is going to start at 10 â€“ and he surely must â€“ it makes sense to embrace some of Harlequinsâ€™ joie de vivre as well. Then again, when did any Six Nations ever unfold precisely to order? It is relatively easy, for instance, to imagine Scotland reaching the last weekend unbeaten, only to fall agonisingly short in Dublin. Irelandâ€™s title prospects would then hinge on the grand finale in Paris between France and England and, potentially, a narrow points difference calculation. Super Saturday? Brace yourself for a succession of them.",FALSE,"pillar/sport","Sport"

So he began combining his acting roles â€“ most famously as Aaron Burr in Lin-Manuel Mirandaâ€™s Hamilton, which earned him an Olivier award â€“ with making music, films and writing. â€œI remember, in Hamilton, talking to Lin about that and he had the same thing: If the stories you want to tell arenâ€™t being told, tell them yourself.â€<9d> Terera is busy doing just that with his latest project: a play about a truly wretched moment in Britainâ€™s slave-trading history which involved the killing of more than 130 enslaved Africans in 1781 on a ship called the Zong, owned by a Liverpool-based syndicate. The massacre occurred after the crew realised they were short of water; the company, having taken out insurance on the lives of the enslaved people, could make a claim when the ship returned home. Terera, 45, has not only written The Meaning of Zong, to be staged at the Bristol Old Vic, but is also starring in it and co-directing with Tom Morris. When we talk on Zoom, he is sipping tea at the end of a day of rehearsals. As the light leaks out of the room, he talks animatedly about the roots of the play. It was due to be staged before the pandemic and last year became a BBC audio drama starring Terera, Samuel West and Michael Balogun. Its inception came in 2014 when he overheard a snatch of conversation as he walked past the actor Anni Domingo. â€œIt was an important moment in my life. As I passed her [at a gathering], I heard the words: â€˜â€¦ the ship where they threw the Africans into the sea and the insurance â€¦â€™ A bell went off. I asked her what she was talking about and I wanted to find out more. I felt it was shameful I didnâ€™t know about this event.â€<9d> He looked into the lives of anti-slavery campaigners Granville Sharp and Olaudah Equiano, read transcriptions of the court cases over the Zong and looked through archives at the National Maritime Museum. A detail from one document struck him: the record of a survivor who showed an extraordinary will to live. â€œA person who was thrown overboard managed to grab on to a rope and pull themselves back up on to the ship. When I read that I immediately thought â€˜OK, this needs to be a piece of theatre.â€™ Thatâ€™s where I started, with that character, because that was someone I wanted to see a play about.â€<9d> Having written The Meaning of Zong, he began plugging away at theatres to stage it. â€œIâ€™ve tried to take this story to different places, different theatres, and there hasnâ€™t always been the appetite for it. Thatâ€™s also what this play is about â€“ three people, Sharp, Equiano and their shorthand secretary, Annie Greenwood, trying desperately to get their stories heard. They meet with massive resistance and I have felt some of that in trying to convince others [to stage the play]. We have a huge, huge issue with coming to terms with and acknowledging our past.â€<9d> What bubbled up for him as he researched it? Anger? Sadness? Injustice? â€œAll of the above, but also a massive joy at the strength of the people that I come from. From the moment someoneâ€™s captured, they are improvising, having to work out â€˜How are we going to survive?â€™ â€˜How are we going to protect each other?â€™ â€˜How am I going to get back home?â€™ Thereâ€™s an ingenuity there that staggered me at every moment.â€<9d> The actions of Sharp, Equiano and Greenwood inspired him too. â€œI thought Christ, if these three people could have done what they did in the face of massive establishment opposition, whatâ€™s my version of that? What is happening in my society which I have to do something about? What you see in Zong is that the power of one person is massive.â€<9d> What does he think of the concept of allyship on social media and of online activism? Is change something we enact in front of our laptops now? â€œSince the Arab spring, weâ€™ve been led to believe in the power of what we can do just by being online. But when you look at the government trying to crack down on what it actually means to protest or use your voice, it becomes even more important that we donâ€™t just tweet about it, that we are prepared to get up and do something.â€<9d> Terera started out wanting to be a musician before enrolling at Mountview drama school to train as an actor. He wanted, initially, to work in films because he had absorbed his motherâ€™s love of movies growing up. But â€œthe parts that you tend to be up for in film donâ€™t necessarily interest me either,â€<9d> he says. Born in Hackney, east London, he was brought up in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. His Zimbabwean father died when Giles was four months old and his mother, a nurse who had come to Britain at the end of the Windrush generation in the 1960s, raised Terera and his sisters (including his twin) on her own. She died in 2007 and her death was a galvanising moment, when Terera realised: â€œYou need to make the most of the time that you have. She made sacrifices. I knew what she had gone through so, for me, now, these are the stories I want to tell and Iâ€™m going to tell them.â€<9d> Until the summer of 2016, he didnâ€™t know anything about Hamilton. â€œI knew I was going to audition for it and my agent had said â€˜Listen to this show [on the original cast recording]â€™. I hadnâ€™t heard any of the hype â€“ although at that point the Tony awards had happened, the cast had just been to the White House and they had filmed the show for what became the movie. When I listened to the CD, I immediately felt that Aaron Burr was a person whose story I had to tell.â€<9d> Has his relationship to the show changed since the discussions on its lead charactersâ€™ associations with slavery? â€œAs soon as I started researching Burr and that period, I was very aware of who these men were and their relationship to slavery. But what I loved about the musical was the casting choices about who was going to tell the story. It had an active sense, I felt, of reclaiming this period and this narrative. When I saw it on Broadway, the thing I was most moved by was that there were people who looked like me, up on stage, telling the story of men and women who are complex and complicated and layered. â€œBy the time it got over here, it had become a pop culture phenomenon and I did wonder if it would have the same resonance. But then weâ€™d go out to perform and when Iâ€™d see people of colour in the audience, I could see from their faces how much it meant to them to be looking at people who looked like them on stage.â€<9d> The Meaning of Zong is at Bristol Old Vic, 2-9 April and 26 April-7 May; at the Lyceum, Edinburgh, 13-23 April; and at Liverpool Playhouse, 10-14 May",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

When itâ€™s a hairspray so thoughtfully scented that a waft of lacquer could legitimately pass for fine fragrance. Perfumed haircare is on the rise. Its pioneer was undoubtedly the late, great hairstylist Oribe Canales. Canales (known simply as Oribe, pronounced â€œOR-bayâ€<9d>) was, in 2008, the first to engage a pair of high-end perfumers to create a luxury fragrance for use in hair products. The result was CÃ´te dâ€™Azur, a blend of apples, bergamot, sandalwood, amber, tuberose, jasmine and vetiver that is widely adored by the beauty community. It smells so good â€“ and is so expensive â€“ that although it is now also available in perfume form (Â£121 for 75ml), one of my friends cheerfully says her signature scent is Oribe Dry Texturizing Spray. Similarly, fans of the American haircare brand Ouai were so taken with its productsâ€™ scents that the firm bottled them as perfume. And signature shampoos and conditioners from dpHue smell so good that a matching home fragrance candle is on its way. I myself have been known to use hairsprays from Sam McKnight not only for the hairdresserâ€™s signature â€œcool girlâ€<9d> mussed-up texture, but also for a hit of the sublime scent created especially for McKnight by British perfumer Lyn Harris. Inspired by the lingering aroma of McKnightâ€™s beloved London garden after a heavy downpour, Harrisâ€™s creation is a blissful blend of wet herbs, roses and an almost steamy accord that is at once refined and sexy. One perfume PR â€“ who has no professional connection with McKnight â€“ tells me that Lazy Girl dry shampoo (at Â£19 itâ€™s a fraction of the price of one of Harrisâ€™s perfumes) is his â€œspecial occasion fragranceâ€<9d>. Kate Moss is also a fan. Celebrity hairdresser Adam Reed is also a fanatical perfume collector, keen on the psychological benefits of fragrance. For his new Arkive range of â€œheadcareâ€<9d> and hairstyling products, Reed prioritised smell as highly as performance. Arkive incorporates two layerable scents â€“ Future Bloom, a white floral with warm vanilla and tart rhubarb; and, my favourite, No One Elsie (Reedâ€™s beloved nanâ€™s name), a mouthwatering blend of green tomato leaves, more rhubarb, honeysuckle and redcurrant. The latter features in The New Form (Â£13), a blow-dry spray that leaves my hair glossy, silky, bouncy and smelling like a hot, 1980s greenhouse that Iâ€™m loth to ever leave.",FALSE,"pillar/lifestyle","Lifestyle"

Itâ€™s metaphorically inexact: we can all hear them, but only some of us come when weâ€™re called. All elections emit a different kind of noise, equally audible, even less likely to be put into words. A â€œwhatâ€™s this really all about?â€<9d> noise. In 2019, it was â€œall politics is futile, circular, boring, childish, and this is your chance to walk awayâ€<9d>. Back then, it was the saddest subliminal electioneering Iâ€™d ever heard, but of course that was before the 2022 local elections, in which the take-home is: â€œWeâ€™re terrible. Theyâ€™re terrible. Everybodyâ€™s essentially terrible. Youâ€™re probably also terrible.â€<9d> So, sure, Downing Street had parties while people in hospitals died alone; but have you heard about the opposition?

And, besides, nobody obeyed the rules all the time, because the rules were stupid. This is an unappealing new consensus, that sensible people saw civic duty all along for what it was: a mugâ€™s game. Iâ€™ve heard callers on BBC Radio 4â€™s Any Answers? argue that everyone watches porn at work, and maybe we should all grow up a little bit; commentators insisting that, hey, politics is bad, but wait until you hear about sexual harassment in the world of finance. Which is worse between a Tory MP whoâ€™s a convicted sex offender, deferring his resignation until the last possible minute, and a Labour MP about whom someone once made a sexual and sexist insinuation? Trick question! Neither is worse or better, in the world of mad equivalence where everyone is corrupt because, who knows, original sin, maybe? I hold out a hope, though, that this wonâ€™t fly in local elections; thereâ€™s something about words such as â€œtransport linksâ€<9d> and â€œrecyclingâ€<9d> that splashes cold water on the face of fevered notions, and makes you think, â€œWait a second â€¦ Iâ€™m not sure I am that bad.â€<9d> Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",FALSE,"pillar/opinion","Opinion"

Companies fob you off, you donâ€™t know your rights or you get sent from pillar to post. Follow these tips to get what you deserve. Put it in writing Always put your complaint in writing. Email is easiest but you can also send it by post. The risk of being pushed from pillar to post is reduced, and you wonâ€™t have to repeat yourself if you need to contact the company again because it will have the details on record. You can keep rewriting before clicking the send button on an email so the risk of losing your temper is reduced and you can make sure you havenâ€™t forgotten anything. Most importantly, though, you have a record of what has been said and when it was said. You may need to take the matter further, for instance, by going to an alternative dispute resolution provider (usually an ombudsman) or making a claim through the small claims court. Phone calls will not give you the evidence you will need if you pursue these avenues. If the company has made it difficult for you to contact it, get the email address of the chief executive; you can do this for free at ceoemail.com. The chief executive may not respond personally (although some do) but your message should escalate the matter and get your complaint noticed and dealt with. Be reasonable Before you raise a complaint, check that you are being objective and that there are grounds for a formal complaint. Complaining about a sales assistantâ€™s clothing would be subjective and inappropriate. But if the assistant threw down and damaged the item you were collecting, complaining about that would be reasonable. However frustrated you may feel, ranting to customer services will not help. You are far more likely to succeed by remaining polite and non-threatening. Know your consumer law You do not need to be able to quote lots of legalese but demonstrating that you know your rights means you are less likely to be fobbed off. Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, you are entitled to goods that are free from defects, of satisfactory quality, match the description and last a reasonable length of time. When you are paying for services, they must be carried out with reasonable skill and care. If your item turns out to be in breach of any of the act within 30 days from purchase, you are entitled to a full refund. After this time you can receive a replacement or repair. Within the first 30 days you will need to prove the problem was there at the point of purchase. But in reality this is rarely questioned. You need a proof of purchase, which doesnâ€™t have to be a receipt. A bank or loyalty card statement would also work as proof. If your purchase breaches any of the CRA requirements, then if you have to send back the item the trader is liable for the postage costs. Contrary to popular belief, you are not entitled to a full refund because you changed your mind. However, the law is different for purchases bought online. Under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013, you have a 14-day cooling-off period from when you receive them. Go to the right place Your contract is always with the company to which you paid the money. So, if your parcel is late or lost, do not contact the courier to complain; contact the retailer instead. For late items, you are entitled to a refund of any extra costs you paid as a result of the lateness. If the courier damages anything, including your property, it is still the retailer who is responsible for putting the matter right, so address your complaints to it. Give a deadline Give the company a timescale by which it has to respond. With an email, five working days is fine as there is no need to factor in time for your complaint to arrive. For letters, you may need to give a little longer. It may be that the company needs longer to investigate. However, it should get back to you before the deadline to tell you when you can expect to hear from it again. A good sentence to end your email with is: â€œShould I not receive a satisfactory response I will not hesitate in taking the matter further. This will include but not be limited to â€¦â€<9d> This could be sharing your experience on social media and various forums or engaging with an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provider or the small claims court. As soon as any deadline has passed, if you have not had a response send a follow-up email outlining further action you will be taking. Say what you want Companies often say that the most difficult thing about dealing with complaints is not knowing what the customer wants them to do to put things right. Make it easy for people to understand what you want and how to give it to you by stating what it is in your letter. Is it a full refund? A repair? An apology? An explanation for poor service? Whatever it is, be clear in your request. Thinking about this will also help you to decide whether you are satisfied with any remedy you are offered. Take the matter further If you do not receive a satisfactory response you have a couple of choices. If the company you are complaining to is a member of an ADR scheme, you can take your complaint to the relevant provider. Some schemes are mandatory for certain sectors such as telecoms (Communication Ombudsman or CISAS, the Communication &amp; Internet Services Adjudication Scheme), energy (Energy Ombudsman) and finance (Financial Ombudsman Service). Non-statutory schemes (so traders do not have to join) include the Motor Ombudsman, whose members include vehicle manufacturers, warranty product providers, franchised dealers, independent garages, networks and bodyshops. The Dispute Resolution Ombudsman runs the Furniture &amp; Home Improvement Ombudsman and the Rail Ombudsman. All the schemes are listed on the website of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute. You can take your issue to the relevant body eight weeks after you first complained or once you have received a deadlock letter from the company. The company is bound by its decision, whereas you are not. If the company is not a member of an ADR scheme or you donâ€™t like the decision, then the small claims court is an option. To show the company you are serious in your intention, send a â€œletter/email before actionâ€<9d> outlining that you intend to take it to court. List the costs, including the court fees. Go to the small claims court websites for England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, fill out everything, right up to payment, take a screenshot and attach it to an email to the chief executive.",FALSE,"pillar/lifestyle","Lifestyle"

Iâ€™m so proud to be a part of its legacy.â€<9d> More than 850 scripts were entered for the prize, which is produced by Ellie Keel and the touring theatre company Paines Plough. Keel called Consumed â€œwarm, funny, deft and sharply observedâ€<9d>, and added: â€œWeâ€™ve got a long way still to go in terms of parity between male and female writers on major stages and I hope that the exceptional plays brought together under the banner of this prize demonstrate that thereâ€™s no shortage of talent: only, in some places, a reluctance to recognise it or give it a chance.â€<9d> Katie Posner and Charlotte Bennett, joint artistic directors of Paines Plough, said they had called each other after reading Consumed and found they had â€œboth been howling with laughter, moved and shocked all within the first 10 pagesâ€<9d>. Consumed is set to be programmed in 2023. In 2020, the prizeâ€™s inaugural year, two scripts won: Amy Triggâ€™s Reasons You Should(nâ€™t) Love Me, which was later staged at the Kiln theatre in London, and Ahlamâ€™s You Bury Me, which had a staged reading during last yearâ€™s Edinburgh international festival.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

The film begins with her walking down an outback road in a beautiful royal blue dress, declaring via voiceover that â€œitâ€™s insane, all of this is insaneâ€<9d> â€“ an accurate description of the contemporary human condition. Flighty, squirrely and eccentric, Wanita is someone most would call â€œa free spiritâ€<9d> â€“ though she is certainly no pushover or shrinking violet; early in the film, Wanita reflects on how her mother once told her Hank Williams died from singing, which led her to think â€œthatâ€™s how Iâ€™m going to goâ€<9d>. There is an inference that Wanita has frittered some of her life away, getting â€œsidetrackedâ€<9d> in Tamworth, New South Wales for 25 years, missing or squandering opportunities, partly as a result of her fickle and bullish personality. But now the subject is a â€œwoman on a missionâ€<9d>, in her own words, who â€œalways goes her own wayâ€<9d> as her husband Baba puts it. This mission â€“ to fly to America and record a full country album â€“ gives the rudderless Wanita a purpose and the film a straightforward â€œon the roadâ€<9d> narrative arc. We follow Wanita and her friends and fellow musos, her manager Gleny, and Archer, who she claims to have found under a bridge, as they travel to Nashville, making some stops along the way â€“ performing to strangers on the street and in the airport, and recording a track in a New Orleans studio. Wanita has a terrific voice, no doubt about it, and â€“ more importantly for the documentary â€“ a colourful turn of phrase. She is charming in a rough and rowdy way, with a straight-to-the-bone candidness and self-effacing style. â€œIâ€™d like to not look like a fuckwit,â€<9d> she says at one point, of her big plan. On another occasion she enters a room and declares: â€œTake your hands off your genitals, the queen is in your presence.â€<9d> In other words, Wanita is â€œgood talentâ€<9d> as they say in documentary land, whose charm is very entertainingly reflected in the tone and texture of the film. Like a rollicking piece of music, Iâ€™m Wanita has a zesty rhythm and tempo; even when thereâ€™s no singing or tunes, one feels inclined to strum their knees and tap their toes to it. It joins a growing list of recent Australian docos presented in aesthetics inspired by the artists they explore, such as The Witch of Kingâ€™s Cross (one of the best homegrown films of 2021), Ecco Homo and Whiteley. This is an easier task to achieve in productions about visual artists, whose work can be presented on screen, rather than those about musicians, beyond peppering the soundtrack with their music. Director Walker does that but also brings visual playfulness, avoiding the boring talking heads format and picking out certain words and turns of phrase from Wanitaâ€™s unpredictable tongue and displaying them in large capital letters, including â€œSOFT COCKERISMâ€<9d>, â€œIâ€™M AN INFINITE NUMBER CONFIDENTâ€<9d> and â€œFUCK! YA KNOW?â€<9d> Iâ€™m Wanita comes together very smoothly and appealingly, with some meaty themes under the hood: this is a film about how life dreams do not (or do not have to) disappear as youth fades. And â€“ without wanting to sound cheesy, because the film certainly isnâ€™t â€“ Iâ€™m Wanita is about embracing life as a journey, rather than a destination. Itâ€™s also a vivid portrait of a very artistic way of living: about the pain, exhilaration, fun, and terror, and the highs and lows of living life outside the prescribed boxes and definitions. Walker doesnâ€™t make the mistake of suggesting this is the â€œrightâ€<9d> or the â€œwrongâ€<9d> way to live, and in fact draws attention to some of the selfish aspects of art as a way of life â€“ articulated primarily by the subjectâ€™s estranged daughter, who clearly has complex feelings towards her mother. Perhaps the core message is that we are all walking in our own way, to our own beat, through the wilderness â€“ or, as the case may be, down an outback tree-lined road, reflecting on the insanity of existence.

Maks Levin has not been heard from since 13 March, when he was reporting in the Vishgorod district, north of Kyiv, where he had been capturing both the fighting and fleeing civilians, according to fellow Ukrainian photographer Markiian Lyseiko. Levinâ€™s phone has been out of service since he sent his last message that morning, when he was stopped while travelling between villages, Lyseiko wrote on Facebook, adding that he believes Levin may have been injured or captured by Russian forces during intense fighting that day. Levinâ€™s disappearance has prompted public appeals for information from fellow Ukrainian journalists. â€œOur good friend, talented war photojournalist Maks Levin, has gone missing. He had yet another field day in a combat zone outside Kyiv on March 13. Ever since then, no one has had any contact with him. If you follow this war, you have definitely seen a lot of his works,â€<9d> tweeted Illia Ponomarenko, defence reporter for the Kyiv Independent. Press freedom groups say that Levin is not the first Ukrainian journalist to have disappeared. The Committee to Protect Journalists said two other journalists, Oleh Baturyn and Viktoria Roshchina, had previously gone missing but have since been released by their abductors, who are presumed to belong to the Russian armed forces. â€œFar too many journalists have gone missing while covering Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, and all parties to the conflict should ensure that the press can work safely and without fear of abduction,â€<9d> said Gulnoza Said, the CPJâ€™s Europe and central Asia programme coordinator. In a Facebook message posted by his sister, which did not identify his captor, Baturyn said he was deprived of water, soap and clean clothes for days. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said that targeting journalists was a war crime, and said that three other journalists had been abducted since the invasion. One journalist, who had been helping foreign media, was beaten, electrocuted and subjected to a mock execution while in detention for nine days. RSF said it would be referring the case of Nikita, whose name was changed for his security, to the international criminal court investigation into war crimes. â€œNikita has given us a chilling testimony that confirms the intensity of the war crimes perpetrated by the Russian army against journalists,â€<9d> said the groupâ€™s secretary general, Christophe Deloire. â€œPassing his testimony on to the ICC prosecutor is the least we can do for this courageous young fixer.â€<9d> Three reporters have been killed during the conflict: Brent Renaud, an American film-maker, Irish cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski and Ukrainian producer Oleksandra Kuvshynova. Television news crews have described being shot at even when they have identified themselves as journalists, prompting speculation that they were targeted on purpose. On Monday, Mstyslav Chernov, a Ukrainian Associated Press videographer, published a chilling account of his experience as one of the last international journalists in the besieged city of Mariupol, where he said Russian troops had attempted to locate him. â€œImpunity is the second goal. With no information coming out of a city, no pictures of demolished buildings and dying children, the Russian forces could do whatever they wanted. If not for us, there would be nothing. â€œThatâ€™s why we took such risks to be able to send the world what we saw, and thatâ€™s what made Russia angry enough to hunt us down,â€<9d> he wrote.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

I would ask anyone who parents a child who has lost a twin in this way to be open about it. I was lucky because my parents were open about my sister; I know many who found out by accident and who have struggled with such an important aspect of themselves being hidden from them, as well as a sense of things falling into place.

Tom &amp; Viv (1994) Dafoe wasnâ€™t natural casting as the clerkly TS Eliot in this literary biopic, which chronicled the poetâ€™s troubled first marriage â€“ and it showed, despite his customary actorly intelligence. If nothing else, it proved that, his highbrow credentials notwithstanding, Dafoe wasnâ€™t really cut out for the anglophile heritage pics that littered the 1990s. 19. Mississippi Burning (1988) A technically precise but essentially unrewarding role in the Alan Parker civil rights pic. Dafoe plays a straight-arrow fed investigating the disappearing of vote-drive volunteers in the Klan-haunted 60s deep south alongside co-star Gene Hackman, who has much the showier role. Leading with razor-sharp side parting and horn-rimmed specs, itâ€™s one of a long succession of cops and authority figures that has paid Dafoeâ€™s rent over the years. 18. Finding Nemo (2003) An inspired bit of voice casting that gave Dafoe his biggest box office result to date. He played Gill, the â€œtank gangâ€<9d> leader who teaches Nemo self-reliance and â€“ crucially â€“ comes up with the schemes to get the fish out of the dentistâ€™s waiting room. Surreal in itself to hear Dafoeâ€™s gravelly tones in a Disney picture. 17. Spider-Man (2002) Dafoe was an early-ish adopter of the new wave of comic-book pics; he wasnâ€™t the first choice for the Green Goblin supervillain role, but it turned out a smart move on director Sam Raimiâ€™s part, with Dafoeâ€™s ability to project both complete sincerity and terrifying menace brought to bear â€“ especially in the now celebrated mirror scene, where the two halves of his personality argue with each other. 16. The Loveless (1981) Dafoeâ€™s first lead role was for a fresh-from-film-school Kathryn Bigelow, co-directing with future Wild at Heart producer Monty Montgomery. A slice of early-80s 50s-revival chic, Dafoe is the super-hunky leader of a Wild Angels-ish outlaw biker gang. Presumably prioritising his work with avant-garde performance outfit the Wooster Group, Dafoe isnâ€™t really relaxed in front of the camera â€“ but he looks amazing, like Audie Murphyâ€™s crackhead cousin. 15. Streets of Fire (1984) Dafoe doesnâ€™t have a whole lot to do until the last 20 minutes of Walter Hillâ€™s DayGlo rockâ€™nâ€™roll musical, and his twitchy greaser supervillain Raven is basically a nastier version of The Lovelessâ€™ Vance. But he makes the most of the climactic fight scene, giving it maximum voltage as he pummels Michael ParÃ© with a platelayerâ€™s hammer. 14. Auto Focus (2002) Paul Schrader has given Dafoe a good number of top-notch supporting roles, and this one, as the alleged murderer of sleazeball TV actor Bob Crane, is one of the most interestingly modulated. As video whiz John Carpenter, Dafoe moves from ingratiating manipulator to desperate killer with impressive conviction. 13. White Sands (1992) Dafoe proved he could carry a mainstream picture with this entertainingly twisty and atmospheric cop thriller directed by Roger Donaldson. Dafoe plays a smalltown lawman who enthusiastically stumbles into a high-stakes espionage kill-off; the patsy-type role doesnâ€™t exactly play to his strengths, but heâ€™s the movieâ€™s solid centre. 12. The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) This was supposed to be Dafoeâ€™s big breakthrough to leading-man status â€“ as ever, he gives it his all, successfully conveying the deadly seriousness of director Martin Scorseseâ€™s intent. But it didnâ€™t really happen for him: Dafoeâ€™s self-lacerating contribution was overshadowed by the wider furore, as the film was engulfed in protests, threats and bans. 11. Platoon (1986) Dafoe had a huge mainstream hit with Oliver Stoneâ€™s vision of the Vietnam war as a lawless charnel house. His role, memorably encapsulated in the filmâ€™s Christ-like poster image, is the filmâ€™s moral conscience, the good angel in Charlie Sheenâ€™s ear. But, as we know, he is cut down by Tom Berengerâ€™s brutal Sgt Barnes and then finished off in slo-mo by the Viet Cong. 10. Wild at Heart (1990) Dafoe is in David Lynchâ€™s Palme dâ€™Or winner for less than half an hour, but what an impact he makes. As sneering triggerman Bobby Peru, equipped with pencil moustache and prosthetic additions to his already-prominent choppers, Dafoe achieved his most alarming grotesque yet. The scene where he terrorises Laura Dernâ€™s Lula is still genuinely upsetting. 9. Shadow of the Vampire (2000) Dafoe got a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for his role in this enterprising take on the making of the influential silent film Nosferatu. Under the layers of makeup and bald cap, Dafoe does an excellent job of making his Schreck/Orlok vampire-actor seem eminently plausible. 8. To Live and Die in LA (1985) In retrospect, the high point of Dafoeâ€™s mainstream pomp. As the vicious counterfeiter Rick Masters, Dafoe makes for a properly scary Hollywood bad guy, opposite William Petersenâ€™s 501s-wearing secret service agent Richard Chance. With Mastersâ€™ background as an artist, itâ€™s a role that could cleverly take advantage of Dafoeâ€™s never-buried-far sensitive side. 7. Tommasso (2019)/Siberia (2020) In Abel Ferrara, Dafoe has found a partner willing to give him free rein to explore his out-there preoccupations â€“ as well as being one of the few directors to give him serious leading roles. These two films, unofficial companion pieces, are arguably Ferraraâ€™s most personal, and show Dafoe at his best: articulate, committed and unfazed by even the weirdest dramatic situations. 6. The Hunter (2011) Dafoe has had to range widely in search of suitably heavyweight roles, and this one took him all the way to Tasmania. As a freelance secret operative assigned to hunt down the supposedly extinct Tasmanian tiger, he could deploy the tricky actorâ€™s craft of just doing things methodically, on his own for long periods. Thereâ€™s a moral crisis thrown in, too, at which Dafoe is a past master. 5. The Florida Project (2017) Dafoe got another supporting actor Oscar nomination for this fatherly role, in which he radiates concern and exasperation in equal measure as a Disney World-adjacent motel manager. The main focus of his anxiety are mother-and-daughter pair Halley and Moonee (Bria Vinaite and Brooklynn Prince); they, in truth, are the filmâ€™s stars, but Dafoe is the ballast. 4. Antichrist (2009) Whether or not you buy into the sincerity of arch provocateur Lars von Trierâ€™s occult horror (and the Guardianâ€™s Peter Bradshaw certainly didnâ€™t), thereâ€™s no doubting the total commitment of Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg, the two main players in this dance of trauma, sex and death. Dafoe is a therapist attempting to treat his grief-consumed wife after their toddler son falls to his death; his super-earnest articulacy is infused with an unfamiliar note of superciliousness â€“ though itâ€™s of course abandoned by the time of the filmâ€™s nightmarish climactic confrontation. 3. At Eternityâ€™s Gate (2018) With his seamed and blocky visage, Dafoe was perfect casting for Vincent van Gogh in Julian Schnabelâ€™s treatment of the painterâ€™s turbulent final months, and the film is very much a communion from one artist to another. The director focuses on Van Goghâ€™s act of looking, and as the possessor of Hollywoodâ€™s most piercing stare, Dafoe carries it off beautifully, as well as convincingly handling the more troubling later episodes. Many have tried to portray artistic rapture on screen without looking like an idiot; Dafoe is one of the vanishingly few who have pulled it off. 2. The Lighthouse (2019) There is something about being matched with a gifted co-star (see Antichrist) that brings out the best in Dafoe, and this two-hander with Robert Pattinson has the added sense of the passing of a baton to a new generation. As the elder and crustier of a pair of men looking after a lighthouse in the late 19th century, Dafoe handles some ripely ornate dialogue with aplomb in a battle of wits and authority with the sulky Pattinson. And like Lars von Trier, director Robert Eggers goes full eco-freaky and puts Dafoe through the wringer physically; the actorâ€™s battered body stands up well. 1. Light Sleeper (1992) In the early 90s, before the juicy supporting roles and eye-catching cameos began piling up, Dafoe looked as if he had a long stint as a leading man in front of him, the sort of career Johnny Depp or Robert Downey Jr have had. Looking back, itâ€™s clear that Dafoe was a shade too uncompromising to connect with audiences in the same way. But this now-unfashionable Paul Schrader film gave Dafoe a near-perfect role: a drug courier with an emotional investment in his clients, lovelorn over his ex-wife, and the unwitting focus of the romantic attentions of his supplier (played by Susan Sarandon). Light Sleeper allowed him to convey all the subtleties that make him a great actor: conviction, honesty, self-doubt and weakness. One of the great performances, well worth revisiting.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

It could be that its material isnâ€™t fully absorbed into the screenplay, but there is real claustrophobia and unease in each insidious microaggression. The setting is an imaginary Ivy League school in New England which now shrilly prides itself on its diversity, where Jasmine (Zoe Renee), a new student and young woman of colour, is unnerved to hear rumours that the room she has been assigned was where the universityâ€™s first black female student took her own life in the 1960s. Meanwhile, in a kind of generational-anxiety parallel, Gail Bishop (Regina Hall), a distinguished scholar with a respected publication record, is thrilled but nervous to have been appointed the first black woman â€œmasterâ€<9d> of one of the universityâ€™s constituent houses. (The word of course has queasy plantation echoes.) Someone these two women have in common is a rather trendy academic, Liv Beckman (Amber Gray) â€“ Gailâ€™s friend and Jasmineâ€™s tutor â€“ who teaches literature and theory. Liv is more overtly radical than Gail on issues of racism and is now up for tenure, which could be undermined by the fact that Jasmine has filed a formal complaint against her for giving her a failing F grade on her paper on The Scarlet Letter. These campus politics, arguably scary enough in themselves, are meshed with the escalating and uncanny happenings that Jasmine experiences, surrounded by sinister and boorish white undergraduates who are in the substantial majority, most disturbingly at a party on the dancefloor when all the excitable white students are raucously shouting out the N-words in Sheck Wesâ€™s Mo Bamba.

Flashbleu Gerald Casale (vocals, bass, keyboards): I was a member of the student organisation that organised the protest against the expansion of the war in Vietnam into Cambodia. I knew two of the four students, Jeffrey Miller and Allison Krause, who were shot and killed by the National Guard. We saw it happen and we saw the Kent newspaper say â€œStudents kill guardsmenâ€<9d>! We realised everything weâ€™d been told was a big lie. We were already making music, but when you see something like that it changes you for ever. When I saw Devo at Knebworth in 1978, supporting Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, Jefferson Starship and Genesis, docile, stoned hippy types suddenly became enraged and hurled missiles at the stage. Have you come across animosity on that scale since? bhunabhoy Mark Mothersbaugh (vocals, keyboards, guitar): Weâ€™d only played small clubs before, so we didnâ€™t even have a crew. We set up our gear wearing blue work gear, ran to change into our yellow stage suits to perform, then changed into the blue overalls again to take the equipment down. The band before us ended their set waving a giant Confederate flag, which the crowd loved. Then we came on. Casale: The difference between UK and US electricity cycles meant our effects units made these hideous warbling sounds. People started throwing things but because the stage was so high they were missing us and hitting other people at the front. The crowd started fighting each other. We got to watch a display of De-Evolution [the bandâ€™s idea that mankind is de-evolving] where it looked like Planet of the Apes. We have faced that scale of animosity since and try to bend it to our advantage. Your appearance on Saturday Night Live in 1978 [performing a radical deconstruction of the Rolling Stonesâ€™ Satisfaction] is permanently etched on the minds of nearly everyone in America aged 15 to 30 at that time. Can you describe how your lives changed in the following weeks? JSpicoli Mothersbaugh: In Ohio, nobody would hire us because they just wanted bands playing Top 40 hits. Often after our first set weâ€™d get paid to quit! So we had a lot of time to work out our aesthetic, with the yellow hazmat suits. Casale: We came to television fully formed. Overnight we went from a tiny club band to blowing up on the national stage. When Ronald Reagan was elected [in 1980], you commented: â€œAmerica turns to a bad B-movie actor to solve all its problems â€“ thatâ€™s even more Devo than we could have predicted!â€<9d> How much more Devo do you think weâ€™ve become since then? Has it all been decline? JPH1964 Casale: Of course. Now weâ€™re seeing the obliteration of truth, which clearly serves the oligarchs, the billionaires and authoritarian rightwingers that want to pull the strings of power, because the population is confused and numb, and ready to do anything they tell them. Itâ€™s very Orwellian. In your classic 1979 album Duty Now for the Future you claim â€œthe futureâ€™s gonna be maintenance freeâ€<9d>. Are you disappointed with how it has worked out? judgefloyd Casale: Thatâ€™s a line from Clockout, a song about toxic masculinity. The idea was that in the future women wouldnâ€™t need men any more because theyâ€™d have too many sex toys â€¦ and, uh, itâ€™s kinda true [laughter]. Famously, brothers in bands can be fractious with each other. How does it work when there are two sets of siblings? HenleyRegatta Casale: This was Mark and Bob 1 [Mothersbaugh] and myself and Bob 2 [Casale]. It worked like nuclear parity. Will your recording sessions with David Bowie ever see the light of day? BluesBuddah Casale: Bowie was supposed to produce Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!, but he had a complicated schedule so locked it on to Brian Eno. But then Bowie showed up in the studio [in Cologne]. Mothersbaugh: While we were setting the gear up, people were hanging around. [Dieter] Moebius and [Hans-Joachim] Roedelius, Holger Czukay. We all ended up jamming with Bowie and Eno, which was recorded on a two-track tape. Everything gets illuminated at some point, so it will probably come out. There seemed to have been tension between yourselves and Eno during the production of your first LP, resulting in a lessening of his influence. Would you consider asking Eno to remix the tapes now to present his vision of the album? David1 Motherbaugh: Brian was great to work with because he let us do what we wanted. I mean, Eno and Bowie would go back in the evening and add stuff to our songs, like Tibetan monkey chants, some of which we used but mostly we didnâ€™t. But he never imposed it on us. Casale: The â€œtensionâ€<9d> has become apocryphal. It wasnâ€™t real tension. Brian was into his Zen period and we had come from Akron, Ohio, steeped in industrial brutalism. We didnâ€™t want our songs to be pretty like he did, but we were never at loggerheads. We loved him. Weâ€™d love to hear him remix those songs now. That would be funny at this point. Is it true that you wrote a song using a washing machine as the rhythm section? CanMeckie Casale: I played guitar to my motherâ€™s machine â€“ it had this sorta kerchunk-kerchunk rhythm. Mothersbaugh: Before drum machines weâ€™d write songs sitting in the car to the rhythm of the windshield wipers. Our first drummer, Jim Mothersbaugh, was a circuit bender and he invented the precursor to electronic drums. How did the Neil Young collaboration come about? Fruitcoverednails Mothersbaugh: The actor Dean Stockwell hired me to score an off-Broadway play for him â€“ Dean had shot films for Neil and introduced him to Devo. Casale: Neil had our self-produced single. We met, Neil loved us and asked us to be in his Human Highway movie. We played Hey Hey, My My together. Mothersbaugh: Neil told us off for selling merch! He said: â€œMerch isnâ€™t cool. Itâ€™s not part of rockâ€™nâ€™roll.â€<9d> [Laughter] Whatâ€™s the story about Johnny Rotten joining Devo? 1234Ramones Mothersbaugh: In winter 1978, we were sleeping on couches at a friendâ€™s house. In Bob Casaleâ€™s room the windows had blown open and in the morning he was covered in a foot of snow. [Virgin Records boss] Richard Branson called and ask if we wanted to get together in Jamaica. Bob and I went to this hotel, where there was a pile of really strong marijuana. Richard waited until we got really stoned and told us that Johnny Rotten was in the next room and he wanted him to be the singer in Devo. I couldnâ€™t stop laughing and told him it was the most absurd suggestion Iâ€™d ever heard. Later, Richard almost killed us. He took us to eat in the mountains and afterwards drove so fast the Jeep slid off the road and got stuck on a tree. We were in the back seat, Bob had landed on top of me and, as I looked down, it was a 100ft drop. Richard started laughing like a crazy ninny. Do you still play Mongoloid? MagnusPym How do you feel about Mongoloid now? Bertchas Casale: Mongoloid is a politically incorrect term, but the song was attacking people who used it to put other people down. I think I probably wouldnâ€™t write that song now, though. Mothersbaugh: We still play it. Itâ€™s one of our core songs, but in those days we were totally uncensored. In the songâ€™s defence, we got dozens of letters from parents of children with Downâ€™s syndrome, saying: â€œMy child is so happy thereâ€™s a song about them and they love the song.â€<9d> Have you seen the UK tribute band We Are Not Devo? How do you feel about such bands doing your music? Wearedevo Mothersbaugh: I listen to these bands and sometimes think: â€œOh, we should have done that.â€<9d> We went to a Polysics show in Tokyo â€“ they do their own music and some homage stuff â€“ and the kids were making hand gestures and intense movements like we wanted at our shows. We used to play easy-listening, instrumental loungecore versions of our songs before we went onstage â€“ parodying ourselves, but people loved it. Warners refused to put it out so we released it ourselves and sold thousands. Mark said that while he had Covid-19 he suffered hallucinations and imagined a new work for Devo. Will we hear some new material? Agustina_argentina Mothersbaugh: When they were moving me around in intensive care, I got hit in the eye. I pulled the tube out of my throat and a guy holding me went: â€œSedate him!â€<9d> The next thing I knew I had these crazy dreams of performing on these inflatable objects five storeys high, with people watching us from below. It was a pretty good show! So new material â€¦ yes, of course. I feel like weâ€™re at the halfway point of Devo. Weâ€™ve got another 50 years. â€¢ Devo have been nominated for this yearâ€™s Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. Inductees will be announced in May.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

","https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/06/novak-djokovic-visa-cancelled-why-is-the-tennis-star-being-kicked-out-of-australia","https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/jan/06/novak-djokovic-visa-cancelled-why-is-the-tennis-star-being-kicked-out-of-australia","Novak Djokovic flew into Melbourne planning to defend his Australian Open title. Instead he is being held in an immigration hotel and, pending a court challenge, is set to be deported after a remarkable series of events led to his visa being cancelled. How did it get to this point? What happened at Melbourne airport? Djokovic arrived at Tullamarine airport in Melbourne at 11.30pm on Wednesday night after a 15-hour flight from Dubai. He was held under armed guard for several hours over concerns with his visa and exemption from vaccine requirements before the Australian Border Force announced his visa had been cancelled. In a statement, ABF said the tennis star had â€œfailed to provide appropriate evidenceâ€<9d> to support his exemption from a requirement to be double vaccinated against Covid. â€œThe Australian Border Force will continue to ensure that those who arrive at our border comply with our laws and entry requirements,â€<9d> it said. â€œThe ABF can confirm that Mr Djokovic failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements to Australia, and his visa has been subsequently cancelled.â€œNon-citizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry or who have had their visa cancelled will be detained and removed from Australia.â€<9d> But wasnâ€™t this sorted out before Djokovic got on the plane? Djokovic, who has refused to reveal his Covid vaccination status, said on Tuesday that he had secured a medical exemption. Tennis Australia and the Victorian government confirmed the exemption had been issued after a two-step process, seemingly clearing the way for him to compete. What is a medical exemption? In December, Tennis Australia released its Covid-19 vaccination policy for Melbourneâ€™s grand slam, which included a process for players seeking medical exemptions to enter Victoria without having to undergo a 14-day quarantine. If an exemption was deemed valid in line with the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) guidelines, the medical exemption would be submitted to the Australian Immunisation Register. As the determining panel was blind, no panellists would ever know the identity of any player seeking an exemption. Criteria listed by Atagi as acceptable reasons for a medical exemption range from acute major medical conditions to any serious adverse event attributed to a previous dose of Covid-19 vaccine. For those who have recently tested positive, that can be a temporary exemption from vaccination for six months. The reason for Djokovicâ€™s exemption is unclear. Why did Djokovic apply? We do not know the details of Djokovicâ€™s application and he has not made his vaccination status public. However, Djokovic previously confirmed he tested positive to Covid in May 2020. So what was the problem with his visa? Although we donâ€™t know the basis for Djokovicâ€™s medical exemption application, the Guardian understands that Tennis Australia was told by the federal government in writing more than once that a recent Covid infection was not an acceptable reason not to be fully vaccinated if you want quarantine-free entry into Australia. A letter from the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, to Tennis Australia in late November made this clear, stating: â€œPeople must be fully vaccinated, as defined by Atagi, to gain quarantine-free entry into Australia.â€<9d> â€œThis means that people who do not meet the Atagi definition of fully vaccinated will not be approved for quarantine-free entry, regardless of whether they have received foreign vaccination exemptions,â€<9d> Hunt wrote. â€œIn relation to your specific question, I can confirm that people who contracted Covid within six months and seek to enter Australia from overseas, and have not received two doses of a TGA approved or recognised vaccine â€¦ are not considered fully vaccinated.â€<9d> An earlier letter was also sent to Tennis Australia from the federal health department. Atagi did not endorse the process that Tennis Australia and the Victorian government put in place, the Guardian has been told. A travel exemption from the border force was not requested and the commonwealth was not engaged. So even though Djokovic had a medical exemption to compete, the actual visa application was a matter for the federal government. This meant the decision fell to the home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, or the prime minister, Scott Morrison. â€œThere should be no special rules for Novak Djokovic at all. None whatsoever,â€<9d> Morrison had said. Has anyone else applied for an exemption? On Wednesday, the Tennis Australia chief executive, Craig Tiley, said 26 players and staff had applied for medical exemptions but only a â€œhandfulâ€<9d> had been granted. Itâ€™s been reported that three other players with the same type of visa and exemption were allowed into the country. What has Djokovic said about vaccination? While he has not made his vaccination status known, Djokovic said in April 2020 he is â€œopposed to vaccinationâ€<9d>. â€œI wouldnâ€™t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel,â€<9d> he said. â€œBut if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I will have to make a decision.â€<9d> What happens now? Novak Djokovic has been moved from a room at the airport to a hotel in Melbourne run by the immigration department. His support staff, including coach Goran IvaniÅ¡eviÄ‡, who were travelling with him, were allowed in without any problems. Djokovic has instructed his lawyers to appeal against the visa cancellation. An urgent hearing was held on Thursday evening. Djokovicâ€™s lawyers succeeded in a bid to stop him from being deported on Thursday with a full hearing in the federal court now scheduled for Monday What has been the political reaction? Djokovic has become something of a flashpoint among the Australian public over the sense that different sets of rules apply to powerful or famous people. Despite previously saying it was a matter for the Victorian government, Morrison was quick to claim credit for the decision on Twitter. At a press conference on Thursday, Morrison also said it was the obligation of the traveller to provide the correct information when they arrived at the border. The president of Serbia, Aleksandar VuÄ<8d>iÄ‡, said he had spoken to the countryâ€™s star. â€œI told our Novak that the whole of Serbia is with him and that our bodies are doing everything to see that the harassment of the worldâ€™s best tennis player is brought to an end immediately. In line with all norms of international law, Serbia will fight for Novak, truth and justice.â€<9d> Djokovicâ€™s father, Srdjan Djokovic, said his son was being â€œpersecutedâ€<9d> and that the Australian government was â€œstomping on Serbiaâ€<9d>. â€œTheyâ€™re keeping him in captivity. Theyâ€™re stomping all over him to stomp all over Serbia and the Serbian people,â€<9d> he said. â€œMorrison and his like have dared attack Novak to bring Serbia to its knees.â€<9d> Morrison said he understood the Serbian governmentâ€™s position but the rules â€œapply to all those who enterâ€<9d>. The episode recalls other dramatic confrontations between visiting celebrities and Australiaâ€™s border control regime. In 2015, Barnaby Joyce, then agricultural minister, gave Johnny Depp 50 hours to remove his dogs, Pistol and Boo, from Australia or warned they would be put down. The Hollywood star had brought them into the country on a private jet while filming on the Gold Coast. Barnaby Joyce went on to threaten the actor with a perjury investigation for smuggling the dogs into the country. It has also drawn renewed attention to the plight of refugees and asylum seekers stuck for months, and years, at the Park hotel, where Djokovic is being held. Detainees have described it as a â€œtorture cellâ€<9d>. Mehdi, a refugee who has spent nine years in detention, told Guardian Australia: â€œThere is a disappointment: everyone wants to ask me about Novak, what the hotel is like for him. But they donâ€™t ask about us: we have been locked up in this place for months, for years. How has the tennis world reacted? Like the Australian public, the decision has split opinion. There was already limited sympathy for Djokovic, but the way the announcement has been handled has not been well received. Australiaâ€™s world No 1 Ash Barty responded to the Australian Openâ€™s decision to grant him an exemption with this: â€œItâ€™s a tough one â€¦ I know how hard it has been for Australians â€¦ but in particular Victorians have had a real rough trot over the last 18 months and two years. I totally understand why they may be frustrated with the decision.â€<9d> Rafael Nadal, who is currently tied with Djokovic and Roger Federer with 20 career Grand Slam titles, also spoke to reporters on Thursday. He said: â€œI think if he wanted, he would be playing here in Australia without a problem. He made his own decisions, and everybody is free to take their own decisions. But then there are some consequences.â€<9d> â€œOf course, I donâ€™t like the situation that is happening. In some way I feel sorry for him. But at the same time, he knew the conditions since a lot of months ago, so he makes his own decision,â€<9d> Nadal said.",FALSE,"pillar/sport","Sport"

AJ Brown, a professor of public policy and law at Griffith University and a board member of Transparency International Australia, told Guardian Australia that donations from lobbyists should be banned outright. He said concerns stemmed from the fact a lobbyistâ€™s core business is to promote the interests of third-party clients. â€œIt defeats the purpose of donation transparency,â€<9d> Brown said. â€œItâ€™s wrong. Thereâ€™s no way to eradicate the risk [that donations may be perceived as coming indirectly from lobbyistsâ€™ clients].â€<9d> Brown said â€œthe same principleâ€<9d> should also be applied to large accounting or professional services firms that work for third-party clients and governments, and which should also â€œnot be making donations to political partiesâ€<9d>. Queensland has banned donations from property developers and property industry bodies. Some of those banned donors are represented by lobbyists who are allowed to make their own political contributions. Since 2020, a state election year, eight large lobbying firms have made regular donations to both major Queensland political parties. The vast majority of that money has gone to Labor, which has been in power in Queensland since 2015. The biggest donor in that period was Anacta Strategies, run by Labor figures Evan Moorhead and David Nelson, who gave more than $160,000 to the Queensland Labor party. Nelson said the company made â€œno apologies for being a Labor firmâ€<9d> and would continue to support the party within the rules. He said Anacta supported ongoing regulation of political donations and that all the companyâ€™s donations had been declared in accordance with the law. â€œQueensland has some of the strictest regulations in the country, with real-time disclosures and donation caps,â€<9d> he said. â€œShould the laws be tightened further we will continue to abide by them.â€<9d> At a hearing of Queenslandâ€™s parliamentary economics and governance committee on Monday, the acting chief executive of the stateâ€™s Crime and Corruption Commission, Bruce Barbour, said there was a â€œserious and urgent need to reform lobbying lawsâ€<9d>. â€œLobbying must be conducted in an ethical and fully transparent manner,â€<9d> Barbour said. At the committee hearing, lobbyists from three firms were asked by Mermaid Beach MP, Ray Stevens, whether they understood public concerns about the source of their donations. â€œDo you understand that the public have great concerns about the appearance of those large donations to political parties, particularly after the success of lobbying by a particular firm to achieve an outcome, and how that is bad for the public confidence in the lobbyist industry?â€<9d> Stevens asked. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The managing director of Liberal-aligned lobbyist Barton Deakin, Andrew Humpherson, said donating to parties on behalf of clients would be regarded as â€œunethicalâ€<9d> under their corporate code. The head of Labor-aligned lobbyist Hawker Brittonâ€™s Queensland practice, Elliot Stein, told the hearing his firm made political donations but that these were not made on behalf of their clients. â€œFrom our perspective we always welcome greater levels of transparency and disclosure,â€<9d> Stein said. â€œUnder our laws, and the nature of how elections are run and required to be funded, political parties will naturally need to attract private investment to run political activities. Any changes to that scheme is a matter for this parliament and weâ€™d welcome it.â€<9d> Electoral Commission Queensland rules require all donors to disclosure whether they are contributing on behalf of a third party. The CCC has expressed concern that lobbying regulation does not capture in-house lobbying, done by employees of larger companies, which are not subject to the same scrutiny as lobbying firms. Barbour told the committee he had concerns about â€œsham arrangementsâ€<9d> where a company might hire whatâ€™s essentially a lobbyist but appoint them to an internal position which is not subject to disclosure. Lobbyist Paul Bini, from Crisis&amp;Comms Co, noted that the electoral commission would require declaration of any donation by a third party. Bini told the committee about 80% to 90% of lobbying was done by larger companies with in-house lobbyists and that these interactions with government were not subject to the same scrutiny as lobbying firms. â€œWith all due respect to the CCC, concerns about sham arrangements and those sorts of things is much less of an issue [than the fact] the regulation misses most lobbying activity. â€œTo create balance and fairness for the clients of lobbyists â€¦ the current system in its current form should be expanded to in-house lobbyists.â€<9d> Stein told the committee: â€œThe activities of companies like ours are the tip of the iceberg.â€<9d> â€œWeâ€™re out in the open, clear, transparent, reported and logged in the public domain. We welcome that transparency.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

The NSW independent planning commission (IPC) has given final approval to Whitehavenâ€™s expansion of its Narrabri underground coalmine in the stateâ€™s north-west. Environment groups and Namoi valley farmers said they were incensed by the decision which comes after public hearings were told by the Lock the Gate Alliance and opponents of the project in February the mine would become the dirtiest thermal coal project in Australia. The NSW Greens and an independent MP said the project would drive further climate catastrophe at a time when residents of the state were already experiencing extreme weather events with greater frequency, had lived through the stateâ€™s worst bushfires and were now in the grips of another flood disaster. â€œClimate change is costing Australians untold emotional and physical damage but this seems to have had no impact at all,â€<9d> the Lock the Gate Allianceâ€™s NSW coordinator, Georgina Woods, said. â€œItâ€™s unfathomable.â€<9d> â€œNo perceived benefit from opening a new coalmine or expanding an existing one can possibly compare to the devastation the climate crisis is already wreaking on Australia.â€<9d> The project will extend the mineâ€™s life by 13 years to 2044 and increase the total coal mined from 170m to about 252m tonnes. The commission has imposed 152 conditions on the project, including requirements that it mitigate its emissions, monitor air quality and groundwater, and offset harm to threatened species habitat. In its statement of reasons, the commission said it found that Whitehavenâ€™s project was not inconsistent with ecologically sustainable development and â€œwould achieve an appropriate balance between relevant environmental, economic and social considerationsâ€<9d>. The commission said it had taken into account the NSW governmentâ€™s mining and emissions reduction policies and acknowledged the concerns of people opposed to the project, particularly due to the carbon pollution it would cause. The statement of reasonâ€™s shows the project is expected to result in 479.5m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions over its life, 455.6m of which would be produced once the coal is exported and used, known as scope three emissions. The project would cause 31.19m tonnes of direct emissions (known as scope one). The commission wrote that the project was a gassy mine and â€œsubstantially increased fugitive methane emissionsâ€<9d> were expected in years 12 to 19 of the development. But it said there were opportunities for Whitehaven to â€œdeploy existing, emerging and future technologiesâ€<9d> to improve its abatement of those emissions and to potentially benefit from â€œnew revenue streams to the mining sectorâ€<9d> by capturing those emissions. Whitehaven Coalâ€™s managing director and chief executive Paul Flynn said the approval was a â€œgreat outcome for the company and the hundreds of employees working at the mineâ€<9d>. He said it was forecast to deliver $599m to the NSW economy and would result in the continuation of 500 jobs for an extra decade. â€œBig investments like Narrabri stage 3 are about lives and livelihoods,â€<9d> Flynn said. The climate spokesperson for the NSW Greens, Cate Faehrmann, said it â€œbeggars belief that as NSW is bearing the brunt of floods, the scale and frequency of which weâ€™ve never experienced before, another massive coalmine gets approved in NSWâ€<9d>. Justin Field, an independent MLC, said the commissionâ€™s decision was â€œunfathomable given the catastrophic climate driven events of the last monthâ€<9d>. He said the NSW Coalition governmentâ€™s planning, mining and climate policies, made projects like this possible. â€œThe fact new coal mining can be approved out to 2044 under existing policy makes a mockery of the governmentâ€™s 50% by 2030 and net zero by 2050 climate targets.â€<9d> Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Whitehaven was awarded its approval just one day after it received another fine for breaches of environmental conditions at one of its projects. On Thursday, the NSW land and environment court ordered Whitehaven to pay $158,750 for polluting a creek with styrofoam balls at its Maules Creek mine site. Late last year, the company was ordered to pay $200,000 for water theft at the same site. But the IPC cannot legally consider the previous actions of a proponent when weighing up an application. Boggabri farmer Sally Hunter described Thursdayâ€™s fine as â€œchicken feedâ€<9d> and the company had â€œnow been rewarded with approvals for an entirely new and destructive expansionâ€<9d>. â€œThis is a disgraceful decision by the IPC and will haunt our region and NSW for generations to come,â€<9d> she said. Flynn said it was â€œno surpriseâ€<9d> the majority of public submissions the commission received from the local area and wider Narrabri region supported the project. The commission received 552 submissions in support of the expansion and 1,205 objections. The majority of submissions that came from people in the Narrabri region were supportive of the project the commission said. â€œWhile today is a great result for Whitehaven, itâ€™s fantastic for the Narrabri region too â€“ last financial year Whitehaven spent nearly $50m with around 81 suppliers based in the Narrabri (local government area),â€<9d> Flynn said. He acknowledged the approval was subject to conditions which related to carbon emissions. He said these aligned with the companyâ€™s plans to reduce the emissions at the mine site over time. A spokesperson for the NSW Department of Planning and Environment said the IPC agreed with most of the Departmentâ€™s recommendations to place strict conditions to minimise potential impacts on the environment and the community. â€œThe Governmentâ€™s 2020 Strategic Statement on Coal Exploration and Mining in NSW, which sets out its approach for transitioning to a low carbon future, recognises the ongoing importance of the coal industry to NSW over the next few decades because it is a significant source of direct and indirect jobs in our regions and underpins prosperity in many local economies,â€<9d> the spokesperson said.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

I have just mentioned that for decades now, the UK charts have been filled with the children of Street Sounds, the dance music compilation series he began 40 years ago. â€œItâ€™s true,â€<9d> he says, when he has composed himself. â€œIâ€™m balding, with a pot belly and a small dick. Thatâ€™s me being objective. But what you said is true.â€<9d> Without ever writing a song, without ever fronting a group, Khan changed the face of British music. He was one of the first cheerleaders for Britfunk, the first to bring electro and hip-hop to the UK, and one of the pioneers of house. Every root of the dance music that has blossomed in mainstream pop grew in the UK thanks to Khan transplanting it from the US. How far ahead of the curve was he? He licensed the first rap smash, Sugarhill Gangâ€™s Rapperâ€™s Delight, to release in the UK. He was the first person to bring Dr Dre over, as part of the World Class Wreckinâ€™ Cru, to play Khanâ€™s 1986 UK Fresh show. When Mory KantÃ©â€™s Yeke Yeke became the first African hit to break in Europe in 1987, Khan had released it on Street Sounds New Africa two years earlier. In 1982, Khan â€“ then 23 â€“ launched Street Sounds, a compilation series that democratised the dance music underground. Suddenly, tracks that had been available only on import in specialist shops, bought by DJs and serious clubbers, were available to all. For the price of one import 12-inch, you could get 12 tracks on an album. Street Sounds had its own section in the high street music chain Our Price; I vividly recall the albums being loaned around by kids at my school in Slough. â€œWhat was being released in the UK was palatable, watered-down soul,â€<9d> Khan says of the early 1980s. â€œIt wasnâ€™t street. Everything that was happening in the clubs was on import, and that was the idea that sparked it. Buying imports was costing me half my weekly salary. I thought: these records are never going to see the light of day in Europe. Why donâ€™t I go to the US â€“ to the labels, producers and artists â€“ and let me license them for Europe? â€œActually, 90% of them didnâ€™t even know where Europe was. They just wanted to sell in the tristate area [New York, New Jersey, Connecticut] and California. For them, getting an advance for a territory they would never sell to anyway â€¦ bonus! No one had approached them before. The majors hadnâ€™t caught on to Black music, street music â€“ they jumped on later. When they saw what we were doing, it became harder for me, because they would hand out million-pound cheques. But before that they didnâ€™t realise the sales potential.â€<9d> Khan was born in Hong Kong to Anglo-Indian parents. His father was an airline pilot who later lost his job for diamond smuggling, and his family came to the UK when he was nine. He entered the music business â€“ not his parentsâ€™ dream for him â€“ in the late 70s, first as a DJ. â€œThey loved my energy,â€<9d> he tells me. â€œIâ€™d put on a record, leave the booth and come out and dance with the crowd, then run back in.â€<9d> Next he was a post boy at the Pye label â€“ at one point, without a home, he spent several months living in their offices â€“ before working in their promotions department on disco releases. â€œThe treatment of dance music was the epitome of racism,â€<9d> he says. â€œThere was a racist attitude to Black music: it wasnâ€™t â€˜seriousâ€™ music.â€<9d> The N-word, he says, was used offhandedly around the industry. â€œIt was just standard vocabulary. It was inbred into the system that you could talk like that, act like that, be like that.â€<9d> But it was Pye that first sent Khan to New York, where he did the deal with Joe Robinson of Sugar Hill Records to release Rapperâ€™s Delight in the UK. â€œAfter the deal was done, Robinson handed me a bundle of notes and said, â€˜Khan, buy some fucking clothes. Youâ€™re representing me now.â€™ That night a gift arrived at my hotel room.â€<9d> He pauses for effect. â€œShe was beautiful.â€<9d> He pauses again. â€œAll we did was watch TV and eat cheesecake. I was 21.â€<9d> From Pye, he set up his own imprint, R&amp;B Records, which introduced the pioneering funk band Imagination. He left that because he felt his backers werenâ€™t paying him enough, and with the support of Maurice Oberstein, who ran the UK arm of CBS, he set up Street Sounds for US tracks and Street Wave for his own artists. â€œHe took that music into the suburbs and the small towns, so it was everywhere,â€<9d> says the DJ Greg Wilson, who adds that Khan was â€œpriming peopleâ€<9d> for the late 80s rave scene. â€œA lot of those people had come out of listening to the Street Sounds Electro compilations. Electro was raw â€“ it really swept everything away that went before and began a new world for dance and pop.â€<9d> It was, Khan and Wilson agree, dance musicâ€™s punk moment: nothing would be the same again. Khanâ€™s A&amp;R process for the compilations was simple. First, he would go to clubs: â€œYouâ€™ll see the records that, within a bar, had people not just dancing but getting down.â€<9d> Second, he would go to New York. â€œI was flying to New York most Fridays and coming back on Mondays. I was collecting the quarter-inch master tape. There were no mobile phones. There was no digital file. I would go see some labels, fly back again. Cut the record on a Monday, have a test pressing by Wednesday because we were doing such volume. Weâ€™d be in production for Friday.â€<9d> Promotion was from the ground up. â€œI used the pirates and the club DJs. All these little pirate stations around the UK were starting to play Black music; the legal stations wouldnâ€™t touch it. Each month, 3,000 vinyls went out, maybe more. If the top DJ in a town plays it, other DJs hear it and buy it and play it â€“ you get it to the kingpin in each area, and they are effectively your promotions department.â€<9d> The first Street Sounds compilation sold around 10,000 copies, Khan says, but they soon started flying off the shelves, aided by the switch to text- and graphic-based designs for the Electro series, designed by John Carver and reminiscent of Neville Brodyâ€™s work for The Face, which gave the records a sleek modernity that the first covers â€“ with graffiti-style writing â€“ didnâ€™t have. Suddenly, new names were being talked about in schools around the UK: Newcleus, Rammellzee, Cybotron, Run DMC. By the sixth Electro compilation in 1984 the direction of travel was clear: it featured both sides of the Roxanne wars between the Real Roxanne and Roxanne Shante, as well as Whodini and Doug E Fresh (credited as Dougy Fresh). Hip-hop was the new thing, and Khan was already on top of it. He was soon overreaching, though. His plans to make his organisation the British Motown (â€œDetroit comes to West Acton!â€<9d> as one ad campaign enthusiastically put it) foundered on the fact that while the Street Sounds albums were selling â€“ the series racked up 57 chart entries in five years â€“ he was less successful hitting the singles chart with artists he signed directly to Street Wave. The UK Fresh festival at Wembley Arena in 1986 â€“ by a huge distance, the biggest hip-hop show in the UK to that point, and for several years after â€“ was a hit, but his Street Scene magazine, centred on Black music, emptied the coffers. Still he persisted, and in a remarkable comeback he set up a new label, Westside, in 1987, and won the licenses to release the Chicago house labels Trax and DJ International in the UK, only to be gazumped by those with deeper pockets. â€œWe had done the hard work and then the artists started signing major deals. What chance did I have? Pete Tong was flying off to Chicago with a blank chequebook: how do you compete?â€<9d> Street Sounds still exists â€“ itâ€™s an internet radio station â€“ and Khan wants to get back to releasing compilations of the most exciting underground dance music from around the world again, maybe four a year. Heâ€™s angry that others are celebrated for bringing hip-hop and house to the UK mainstream: â€œPeople credit Paul Oakenfold and Pete Tong and it fucks me off. People have tried to change the history and it hurts me.â€<9d> Wilson thinks thatâ€™s because the collapse of Street Scene left others out of pocket and resentful of Khan for their losses, and because a new generation came to dance music in the late 1980s and simply assumed Ibiza in 1987 was the year zero, with no appreciation of what had come before. â€œThereâ€™s nothing about him in the books, even though heâ€™s a central figure in the history of British dance culture,â€<9d> Wilson says. â€œHe was young, he was brave, and he was prepared to put his reputation on the line.â€<9d> Heâ€™s older now, but Morgan Khan remains indefatigable, and convinced talent will surface through the dross â€“ and that he will find it next. â€œIâ€™m appalled by bedroom DJs who put out these shit beats and everyone thinks they can make music,â€<9d> he says, before smiling. â€œBut the next Prince is out there.â€<9d> Morgan Khan on his favourite discoveries Sugarhill Gang â€“ Rapperâ€™s Delight (1979) â€œCredited for introducing hip-hip to the mainstream, even though it was preceded by the Fatback Bandâ€™s King Tim III (Personality Jock) by a few months. Sylvia Robinson, the producer, wanted to capture on vinyl the phenomenon of rappers performing live at block parties in the Bronx â€“ its significance still can not be overestimated.â€<9d> Imagination â€“ Body Talk (1981) â€œMy first own label release, on R&amp;B Records. Imagination dared to be different with their signature sound and overtly camp stage persona; groups like Imagination proved that Britfunk and soul could take on the Americans, and laid the foundations for the next generation of groups like Soul II Soul.â€<9d> Hashim â€Žâ€“ Al-Naafiysh (The Soul) (1983) â€œA new tour de force would soon empower the music of the street, and Al-Naafiysh (The Soul) epitomised this new music: electro, the driving force behind the emergence of B-boy culture, breakdancing, graffiti and the boom box.â€<9d> Cheryl Lynn â€“ Encore (1983) â€œCBS UK had decided not to release this track as a single, despite the pedigree of the artist, and that the song was written and produced by the highly successful Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. They said they did not see it as a hit, or [an] artist worth promoting â€“ you can deduce why. I persuaded them to license me the track and through our very capable street promotions network, we took Encore into the Top 75. I then received a call: it was suggested by certain powers to halt the chart progress so as not to further embarrass CBS UK to their American bosses.â€<9d> Rose Royce â€“ Magic Touch (1984) â€œRose Royce had substantial hits in the 70s with lead singer Gwen Dickey, including Car Wash and Wishing on a Star. Unfortunately, Gwen leaving the band coincided with a change in the style of music being played in clubs. Magic Touch did nothing in the US, whereas in the UK, Street Wave had a huge record â€“ the track has become a staple anthem at soul weekenders ever since.â€<9d> Joe Smooth â€“ Promised Land (1987) â€œHouse music was born in Chicago, and Promised Land was the quintessence of the genre at its birth. The soulful vocals of Anthony Thomas over the straight four-to-the-floor bass drum became the template for pop music today.â€<9d> Humanoid â€“ Stakker Humanoid (1988) â€œThe fact we produced, recorded and mixed this track at our studios in Ealing always gives me a sense of pride â€“ we created one of the biggest records of the acid genre, and opened the door to the acid-jazz movement.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

But their â€œintelligence reportâ€<9d>, which included Facebook and LinkedIn posts dating back as far as 2015, was dismissed by a tribunal reviewing her case as â€œfar from soundâ€<9d>. Confirmation of the practice, labelled â€œoutrageousâ€<9d> by one federal senator, comes from a recent judgment in a long-running Administrative Appeals Tribunalâ€™s (AAT) case seen by Guardian Australia. Crucially, the tribunal found the applicant, a woman in her 30s diagnosed with hypermobility spectrum disorder and a number of other conditions, was eligible for the scheme. This overturned the agencyâ€™s previous decision. The woman battled the NDIA for support for 21 months in the case, in which the AAT was tasked with reviewing the agencyâ€™s decision to knock back her national disability insurance scheme (NDIS) application. In response to a report from the womanâ€™s treating rheumatologist, the NDIA asked a different specialist to assess her and prepare his own report. Several days before the doctor sent over his findings, the agency sent him â€œadditional material for consideration in the preparation of your reportâ€<9d>. According to the AAT judgment, the specialist was told â€œnot to forward or share the documents attachedâ€<9d>. The rheumatologist called by the NDIA drew upon the â€œintelligence reportâ€<9d> to find the woman did not experience â€œsignificant functional impairmentâ€<9d> from her chronic pain, the tribunal said. The social media was prepared in October 2020. The report commented on some of the womanâ€™s Facebook and LinkedIn social media posts, the AAT judgment said. Some of the posts on which the report was based, it noted, were from 2015 and 2017. This was despite the fact the woman had said her condition deteriorated significantly in 2018 and she lodged a statement outlining her AAT appeal in 2020. The AAT judgment did not provide much detail about the content of the dossier, but one post raised by the NDIA was a comment she had sent to a supermarket in which she complained the store was out of fruit. The tribunalâ€™s decision noted that if the NDIA were suggesting this post called into question claims she made about her ability to go shopping, it did not do so. The decision said the post was not inconsistent with her prior statement that she did not go shopping alone, noting the post used the word â€œweâ€<9d>. Tribunal says report â€˜far from soundâ€™ More broadly, the tribunal found the â€œintelligence reportâ€<9d> prepared by the NDIA was â€œfar from sound on its faceâ€<9d>, and it criticised the decision to provide this to the doctor as â€œregrettableâ€<9d>. The judgment also noted the woman had tendered as evidence other posts to argue the NDIA had â€œselectivelyâ€<9d> picked out parts of her social media history. The womanâ€™s doctor diagnosed her with hypermobility spectrum disorder in 2018. Her condition means her joints stretch more than normal, leaving her at risk of injury. She also lives with chronic pain and fibromyalgia. The tribunal heard she often used a walking stick or wheelchair and sometimes experienced â€œextreme painâ€<9d>. While in agreement on the womanâ€™s diagnoses, the experts differed in some respects. Her doctor suggested her hypermobility condition would worsen over time. But the specialist witness called by the NDIA told the tribunal that patients did not tend to get more hypermobile as they got older. His report contained â€œa number of assertions that he saw no evidence to support her self-reports of widespread painâ€<9d> after examination, the tribunal decision said. The tribunal preferred the evidence of the womanâ€™s own specialist, noting it was the result of several interactions with the woman. It rejected the NDIAâ€™s claim the woman was â€œnot a witness of truthâ€<9d> and accepted her evidence. Guardian Australia has chosen not to name the woman. The social media report provides further insight into the lengths to which the agency is going to fight the growing number of legal appeals brought by people trying to get on to the NDIS or who are unhappy with cuts to their plans. Advocates have criticised the agency for taking a â€œcombativeâ€<9d> approach and spending millions of dollars on private law firms to contest cases against vulnerable applicants. The use of social media monitoring and even private investigators to surveil welfare recipients is a longstanding practice in the social security system, but within the NDIS fraud investigators have focused on NDIS providers. Laborâ€™s NDIS spokesperson, Bill Shorten, accused the government of â€œmanaging the NDIS through legal actions against participantsâ€<9d>. â€œThere is something utterly dysfunctional going on when genuine people with disability are treated like frauds while the real fraudsters pillage the scheme,â€<9d> he said. The Greens senator Jordon Steele-John said assessments should be based on the evidence of specialists and the personâ€™s own goals and experience, not â€œcherrypicked social media postsâ€<9d>. He said the NDIAâ€™s conduct was â€œoutrageousâ€<9d>. Guardian Australia asked the NDIS minister, Linda Reynolds, if she was comfortable with NDIA staff reviewing the social media of NDIS applicants. A spokesperson said: â€œUnder the NDIS Act, decisions on participant disability-related supports are made independently from the Minister of the day. â€œThis ensures separation in what can be complex decisions based on specialist advice.â€<9d> An NDIA spokesperson said there was â€œno internal process where NDIA staff view prospective or current participantsâ€™ social media accounts to inform access or planning decisionsâ€<9d>. â€œAll decisions are made in accordance with the NDIS Act,â€<9d> the spokesperson said. â€œIn external AAT review processes, the use of open source information by the Agency is not common practice. â€œIt is a matter for the tribunal to form its own view on the usefulness or value of evidence in AAT matters when performing its obligations under the AAT Act.â€<9d> Legal Aid NSW, which represented the woman, said it was unable to comment.

Ministers privately acknowledge that â€œrethinkingâ€<9d> fracking would be politically very difficult. Those areas most ripe for the controversial oil and gas extraction method are marginals in the â€œred wallâ€<9d> of constituencies in the north that historically have tended to be Labour, many of which were won by the Tories in 2019. Many of the others are former safe Conservative seats in the south where the Liberal Democrats are limbering up to pick off disillusioned former Tory voters. When asked if they would support fracking in their constituencies, only five of the 138 MPs whose areas contained onshore exploration licences said they would, with 41 opposed. The remainder either did not reply or declined to comment. Even those Conservatives who make positive noises about restarting fracking in principle are wary about saying they would like it in their area. Kevin Hollinrake, Conservative MP for Thirsk and Malton, has been full-throated in his support for fracking. However, when approached about whether he supported drilling in his constituency, he seemed more lukewarm on the issue. â€œI have long been an advocate for producing our own gas rather than importing it,â€<9d> he said. â€œI am supportive of fracking if it is safe. However, it is an intense and slow process due to the number of well sites that are required and there have been induced seismicity issues when this was tried previously. Resuming fracking would not solve the immediate crisis as it would take at least 10 years to produce the quantities of gas required to meet our needs.â€<9d> Similarly, Nigel Mills, the Conservative MP for the Amber Valley in Derbyshire, has said fracking could be good for the UKâ€™s energy independence but he did not support it in his constituency. He said: â€œFracking should only take place away from where people live and so there are no suitable sites in Amber Valley.â€<9d> Even MPs in the Net Zero Scrutiny Group have reservations about fracking in their areas. The MP for Blackpool South, Scott Benton, has said he would be reluctant to allow fracking in his constituency because of the earthquakes it had caused in the past. Joe Twyman, founder of the polling company Deltapoll, said this attitude tracked his research on public opinion about fracking. The most recent surveys on the issue, he said, showed that while people were often positive about the principle of fracking, they did not want it happening in their area. Twyman said intense arguments about infrastructure could often have a large impact locally, and that could cost the Conservatives seats. â€œAs we have seen with HS2, important local factors that are sometimes unique to a constituency, can have a significant impact on voting. Fracking is the kind of issue that has the potential to have a similar impact, if not larger. Consistently a majority of the British public have been opposed to the idea of fracking in their local area and it is unlikely that recent developments around energy security will change that,â€<9d> Twyman said. The Labour party has already seized on worries over the governmentâ€™s potential U-turn on fracking, releasing their own energy plan which is focused on renewables, and emphatically rejecting the idea of onshore drilling. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change and net zero minister, said: â€œFracking is the wrong choice for Doncaster and it is the wrong choice for our country. It is unsafe, expensive, and does not command public support. Instead, we need a clean energy sprint, by accelerating homegrown renewable and nuclear energy â€“ the cleaner, cheaper choice. â€œLabour has a plan to expand wind, solar, and wave power, as well as a home insulation plan to bring down energy bills. This is the best route to tackle the climate crisis, the cost of living crisis, and our energy security crisis together. We need a clean energy sprint for national energy independence and sovereignty.â€<9d> In the south, the Lib Dems came second to the Conservatives in many seats in areas with onshore exploration licences, including West Dorset, Mid Sussex, and Guildford. Local infrastructure concerns, such as HS2 and the governmentâ€™s plans to relax planning laws to make it easier to build homes, have cost the Conservatives dearly in many southern constituencies. Political campaigners in these areas seem aware that another shock to the Conservatives such as last yearâ€™s Chesham and Amersham byelection could be in store if shale drilling were allowed to take place in these constituencies. At the time, the Lib Dems acknowledged that local anger over planning laws was a driving factor in their winning the previously safe Conservative seat. But despite all this, the culture war is likely to rumble on, not least as there is a small but vocal group of backbenchers determined to have the argument on fracking. One such MP is Christopher Chope. Perhaps put at ease by his majority of nearly 24,000, he has said he would support fracking in his constituency of Christchurch in Dorset. Chope, who represents a seaside constituency with one of the most elderly electorates in the UK, said: â€œI am a strong advocate of the UK maximising its own energy resources to reduce dependency on foreign imports. This would be of enormous benefit to my constituents in the battle against rising energy costs in both the long and short term.â€<9d> However, even he added the careful caveat: â€œThere should be no exceptions, but all new developments should be subject to planning permission.â€<9d>",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Mariella Gedge-Rogers, 27, also climbed on to the roof of the Bridewell police station in the centre of Bristol and threw missiles at officers. During the violence that erupted in March 2021 after a peaceful â€œkill the billâ€<9d> protest, officers were attacked, their vehicles set on fire and the police station vandalised. Video footage released by the police shows Gedge-Rogers, from the Clifton area of the city, telling the officer she hit â€œI know youâ€™re a human beingâ€<9d>, to which he replies: â€œYouâ€™ve just hit me with a skateboard though.â€<9d> She says: â€œI did do that, yes.â€<9d> She was also seen throwing objects at other officers from the police station roof and repeatedly striking the front window of the building with her skateboard before passing it to a man for him to do the same. Judge James Patrick, sentencing Gedge-Rogers, said: â€œYou used your skateboard as a weapon and threw missiles and objects. You had had a considerable amount of drink.â€<9d> Speaking of the impact of the rioting on officers, Patrick said: â€œVile abuse was directed at the police. At least one firework was discharged, officers were pulled from their lines. They were physically attacked, some with missiles, some with weapons, and others were struck, spat on, kicked and punched.â€<9d> He added: â€œExperienced police officers, some with military experience, describe it movingly. One with significant services experience described it as one of the most frightening experiences in his career.â€<9d> Another said it was â€œlike a war zoneâ€<9d>. Patrick accepted Gedge-Rogers had shown remorse and was ashamed of what she had done. â€œPeople who knew you identify that you have behaved out of character,â€<9d> he said. Gedge-Rogers, who was convicted by a jury of riot, will be expected to serve half her sentence in custody and the other half on licence. Avon and Somerset police were criticised by some activists at subsequent â€œkill the billâ€<9d> demonstrations for what they said was heavy-handed tactics with horses and dogs being used to disperse protesters. Kannan Siva, defending, said Gedge-Rogers acted out of character and contributory factors were her complex mental health issues and alcohol consumption. He told the court she attended the 21 March protest with peaceful intentions but her behaviour changed after she was forcibly restrained. Gedge-Rogers is the 14th person to be sentenced in connection with the riot. Those dealt with so far have been jailed for a combined total of more than 50 years.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

The Yorta Yorta, Gunditjmara, Dja Dja Wurrung and Wiradjuri woman died in custody while on remand for shoplifting offences on 2 January 2020. She had spent 80 days on remand in the previous 12 months awaiting bail for shoplifting offences â€“ the same offences for which she was remanded in custody again on 30 December 2019, three days before her death. At the Melbourne coronerâ€™s court this week, an inquest into the 37-year-oldâ€™s death has been examining the circumstances surrounding her bail hearing on 31 December 2019. It has also been examining Victoriaâ€™s bail laws, which the court heard have had a significant impact on the ability of Aboriginal women who are before the court on minor offences to be granted bail. The evidence so far has detailed how police errors, a lack of legal representation and a change to bail laws contributed to putting Nelson behind bars. Police form â€˜riddled with mistakesâ€™ Nelson was arrested outside Southern Cross station at 3.35pm on 30 December and taken to the Melbourne West police station. She was arrested on two outstanding warrants relating to failing to attend the Koori court in Shepparton to be sentenced for shoplifting charges. Police had also issued three whereabouts notices, seeking to interview her in relation to further shoplifting incidents alleged to have occurred in October and November 2019. The remand form to be presented before the magistrate was completed by senior constable Rebecca Gauci. Under cross-examination from Rishi Nathwani, the lawyer representing Nelsonâ€™s mother, Aunty Donna Nelson, Gauci admitted that the form was â€œriddled with mistakesâ€<9d>. Gauci had checked the box suggesting that granting Nelson bail would pose â€œunacceptable riskâ€<9d> to the safety and welfare of others. She told Nathwani she ticked that box because Nelson was stealing to â€œfund her lifestyleâ€<9d> and drug addiction, and there was a risk that she could respond violently if â€œconfronted by a staff member who wants to protect their propertyâ€<9d>. But she agreed, under questioning from Nathwani that there was no evidence of Nelson ever acting in a violent or even confrontational manner. â€œSo thereâ€™s never once been a suggestion â€¦ [that] sheâ€™s ever assaulted or threatened the welfare of anyone?â€<9d> Nathwani asked. â€œNo,â€<9d> Gauci replied. Gauci agreed with Nathwaniâ€™s statement that the box â€œshouldnâ€™t have been tickedâ€<9d> and that the form she prepared was â€œa document riddled with mistakesâ€<9d>. Nelson did not speak to the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service Under Victorian law, police must notify the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service (VALS) when an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person is taken into custody. That notification was made about 4pm on 30 December 2019. VALS records, put before the court, say that they called the police station at 4.27pm and were told that Nelson was currently being interviewed by police and did not want to speak to anyone from the VALS. Gauciâ€™s notes put the time of first call at 4.07pm, but also say that Nelson did not want to speak to VALS. VALS says they made a total of four attempts to contact Nelson between 4.27pm and midnight. They did not get through. The bail hearing Nelson was taken to the Melbourne custody centre, the cells underneath the Melbourne magistrates court, at 7pm, arriving too late for her bail application to be heard that night. She spoke to a duty lawyer for Victorian Legal Aid, Peter Schumpeter, who then contacted Nelsonâ€™s lawyer, Jill Prior. Prior is the principal legal officer of the Law and Advocacy Centre for Women and had acted for Nelson since December 2018, when she was on remand on shoplifting charges. The next morning, on 31 December 2019, Prior had a phone conversation with a barrister named Tass Antos and briefed him to represent Nelson in her bail application. Antos spoke to Nelson in the cells. But when her bail application was called, Nelson represented herself and was denied bail. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Prior told the inquest she was of the view that Antos would be appearing for Nelson on behalf of the Law and Advocacy Centre for Women, and would be paid by them â€“ either via a grant of legal aid or, if legal aid were not granted, by Prior herself. She said she had listened to an audio recording of the bail hearing, which was played before the inquest, and that there were â€œglaring absences of informationâ€<9d> concerning Nelsonâ€™s health. Antos told the inquest on Thursday that he had not represented many Aboriginal people in his career. He repeatedly said he could not recall details of the hearing or the conversations he had with Prior around the hearing, but said to the best of his memory there may have been â€œhigh hurdles to getting bailâ€<9d>. He agreed under cross-examination that he may have offered Nelson the option of representing herself so as not to jeopardise a future bail application. The bail act Gauci told the inquest that police opposed bail because Nelsonâ€™s offending met the threshold for the â€œexceptional circumstancesâ€<9d> test in the Victorian bail act. It puts the onus on an accused person to show that compelling reasons or exceptional circumstances exist for them to be granted bail. It previously applied only to very serious offences, like murder, but the act was changed in 2018 to broaden the circumstances for which this test can be applied Nelson met the â€œexceptional circumstancesâ€<9d> test because she was accused of having breached bail and having committed an indictable offence while on bail. Prior said that the change to the act had created a â€œdire landscapeâ€<9d> for the granting of bail because the lowering of the threshold for the exceptional circumstances test meant that people were being remanded in custody for offences that would not ordinarily carry a sentence of imprisonment. â€œThe categorisation of bail thresholds as exceptional circumstances in my experience is almost the norm,â€<9d> Prior told the inquest. â€œThe very vast majority of our clients would present with an exceptional circumstances threshold. All of our clients are women. At least 40% are Aboriginal women â€“ the vast number of those clients are presenting with offences that could be categorised as less serious offences. Not offences against the person; property offences, breaching offences.â€<9d> On Tuesday, Sharon Lacy, the counsel assisting the coroner, said that 61.4% of all Aboriginal women held in Victorian prisons as of 1 June 2021, were held on remand. â€œLike Veronica, over three-fifths of Aboriginal women in custody at any given time are waiting for their matter to be heard,â€<9d> Lacy said, in her opening address to the court. â€œThey may never receive a prison sentence but are held in prison on remand. This inquest will consider what mechanisms are involved in making this so.â€<9d> The inquest continues.",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

Some might call it greedy â€“ I call it keeping my options open. That said, Iâ€™d be the first to admit that having a roster of fragrances on tap can be expensive â€“ and confusing. So if you prefer scent monogamy, consider these. Violette FRâ€™s oil perfume is predominantly vetiver, but lightened with ylang-ylang and bergamot. And itâ€™s easy to cart around. Serge Lutens? Not so much, but the cult cedarwood and plum scent â€“ which celebrates its 30th birthday this year, hence the special-edition bottle â€“ is no less desirable. Rose lovers: Kilianâ€™s offering is audacious; it includes bergamot and orange blossom as well as a dash of marshmallow. Tom Ford Rose de Russie is leather-infused and Loeweâ€™s Templo de Debod adds coconut, oud and saffron for an unexpected twist. Prefer fruity but grown-up? Chanel No 1, Gabarâ€™s Swim (blackcurrant meets mossy) and HermÃ¨sâ€™ Rhubarb are exquisite options. Citrus scents have universal appeal: Jo Malone Londonâ€™s Italian-inspired scent will have you booking a holiday. Thereâ€™s also bergamot in Fragrance X by Trish McEvoy, however the myrrh, sandalwood, and amber give it a deliciously musky slant. All different but all unforgettable.

The actor was the only one of the original Sex and the City cast to decline to join And Just Like That â€¦, the sequel to the much-loved, era-defining show. The rest of them stayed, and suffered. But at least they were getting paid. Viewers â€“ if they did stay, which many of us did out of a potent blend of desperate hope that things would improve, and fascinated horror as they did not â€“ had no such solace. The end of the 10-episode run has now been reached, with the finale refusing to redeem anything that had gone before. It could have, should have, been great. The idea of best friends Carrie, Charlotte and Miranda returning to navigate the complexities of female life and friendship in their 50s â€“ a rare televisual sight â€“ was a fine one (even if Cattrallâ€™s Samantha would be missed). New writers and characters were brought in to address the glaring whiteness and heteronormativity of the original. Michael Patrick King was in charge, as he had effectively been for much of Sex and the City. But what we got was a shambles. On every front, it was a mess. Some of it was no oneâ€™s fault. Claims from several women of sexual impropriety by Chris Noth (Carrieâ€™s husband, Mr Big) meant he had to be hastily written out of flashback scenes. (Noth has described the allegations as â€œcategorically falseâ€<9d>.) Willie Garson (Carrieâ€™s beloved friend Stanford) sadly died unexpectedly during shooting and a major storyline for him had to be abandoned, and the cracks papered over. The rest, however, was the result of deliberate and often bafflingly tone-deaf decisions. Samantha â€“ one absence the show had plenty of warning about â€“ was written out clumsily and unbelievably (the woman who had been diehard, diaphragm-fishing friends with Carrie for decades supposedly left for London in a huff after Carrie departed her PR firm). Characters of colour were written in with cringe-making crassness. They were given a maximum of one feature each (having doubts about IVF! Being unhappily single! Being â€“ uh â€“ a rich mother!) and paired off with one each of the trio to address their unwoke blind spots. Because thatâ€™s what normal people do? Because thatâ€™s what actors of colour are there for? It was virtually the â€œmagical negroâ€<9d> trope, dressed up in designer clothes. The whole endeavour seemed like a box-ticking exercise, without any effort to weave zeitgeisty concerns into the whole â€“ let alone manage it with the grace and humour that defined Sex and the City. Charlotte got a gender-fluid daughter (she wasnâ€™t anything else. Just gender-fluid. Thassit). Miranda got Che Diaz (Sara Ramirez), Carrieâ€™s non-binary boss, for whom Miranda leaves Steve after Che delivers her unto the heights of sexual ecstasy in Carrieâ€™s kitchen while the abandoned, post-operative owner wets the bed. If this sounds like narrative chaos to you in summary, be assured it played no better in real time. Most disconcertingly of all, Miranda, Carrie and Charlotte seemed to have been written by people who had never seen or heard of Sex and the City. Mirandaâ€™s biting wit and cynicism were gone â€“ they made her a quivering bunch of neuroses (with a drinking problem that disappeared almost before it had arrived) in a terrible grey wig instead. Carrie was a rich, grieving widow, devoid of all the scrappy drive and snappy lines that made her bearable the first time round. And Charlotte simply flapped over her non-problems through every episode. The promised exploration of the ageing process never came. A brief discussion of the ethics of hair dye here, a mention of menopause there, and Mirandaâ€™s leg going to sleep after sheâ€™d sat at a picnic table for lunch (again, it didnâ€™t work any better if you saw it), and we were done. That Carrieâ€™s hip problem turned out to be a congenital birth defect and not an â€œold ladyâ€<9d> issue was emblematic of the whole show â€“ frightened to show anything real, and taking the least troublesome way out possible, regardless of credibility. The women wandered through 2022 as if they had been asleep rather than simply off our screens for the last 20 years, so frightened by new concepts were they, so deep their levels of cultural estrangement. I donâ€™t know the age range of the writers, but their work suggests that even their combined years barely made it into double figures. What could have been another groundbreaking iteration of the show was instead a regressive, embarrassing disappointment. And just like that â€“ weâ€™re back to square one.",FALSE,"pillar/arts","Arts"

On balmier days, with the windows open, he can hear the roar of the 308ft Lower Falls tumbling into the chasm. In autumn, he is treated to the sound of bugling bull elk in rut or, in the middle of night, the howls of wolves. A key part of Fullerâ€™s professional responsibility in winter, when deep snow and bone-chilling cold shuts down tourist operations for five months in the centre of Yellowstone, is removing snow from building rooftops to prevent them from collapsing under the weight of the load. His solitary existence might seem idyllic, but when Fuller and his English wife, Angela, landed the winterkeeping assignment in 1973, there wasnâ€™t a long line of competitors. He was the only applicant. â€œBack then, being a winterkeeper at Canyon was considered a hardship post where the isolation was reputed to drive people crazy,â€<9d> Fuller remembers, noting they had no phone or TV and the internet was decades away. In the evenings, they listened to BBC news broadcasts via shortwave radio. â€œThen again, in those days, the world seemed a much bigger place, with fewer of us on the planet and such a thing as solitude wasnâ€™t in short supply,â€<9d> he adds. Today, the proliferation of digital technology, which enables faster-paced park visitors to share a selfie on social media from the remotest mountain peaks, has made Yellowstoneâ€™s vastness feel smaller, he says. The bittersweet lament comes as Yellowstone marks its 150th anniversary on 1 March as Americaâ€™s first national park and one of the first in the world. For Fuller it coincides with his 49th year as Yellowstone winterkeeper, the longest anyone has held the post in the parkâ€™s history. â€œGoing back to the 19th century, winterkeepers tended to be basically backwoods good olâ€™ boys, and not necessarily with a high level of education,â€<9d> retired Yellowstone park historian Lee Whittlesey says. â€œThey were looked upon as refugees from civilisation, trying to get away by hiding out as hermits. Steve Fuller has done a lot to change that prosaic image, but he has his own Thoreauvian place as an anomaly in the 21st century.â€<9d> Fuller says the changes he has observed in Yellowstone have been profound. â€œItâ€™s difficult sometimes to sort out the paradoxes,â€<9d> he says. Yellowstone is coping with record numbers of visitors and yet, Fuller notes, the park is in some ways wilder than when he arrived. Grizzly bears, whose numbers in the park dipped to just 136 in the 1970s, have been rescued from a population freefall. Wolves, deliberately exterminated by park rangers in the 1920s, were brought back in the mid-1990s. And bison population, which numbered just 23 at one point in the late 19th century, is today at 5,000. In 1973, the year Fuller arrived, there were slightly more than 2 million visits recorded in Yellowstone. Last year, Covid-19 set off a rush of people to the park and there were nearly 4.9 million â€“ 800,000 more than in 2019, the year before the pandemic struck. This year, given the publicity for the parkâ€™s 150th anniversary, Yellowstone may surpass 5 million visitors. Tourism brings millions of dollars in revenue to neighbouring communities and creates thousands of jobs but the growing numbers have come at a cost, says Fuller. â€œTraffic congestion in summer is a lot worse â€“ a lot. I experience it first-hand,â€<9d> Fuller says. â€œIâ€™m reluctant to go anywhere in the park during the day when I have free time. You might set out on a drive that would ordinarily take you 30 minutes, but the chances of getting stuck in traffic and taking three times as long are good.â€<9d> Most tourists stick to the roads and short trails, directly affecting only about 2% of the parkâ€™s 8,900 sq km (2.2m acres), notes Yellowstone superintendent Cam Sholly. Scenes of traffic gridlock and full carparks are real, but they create an inaccurate perception, Sholly says. Most of Yellowstone is sparse of people and the farther one wanders away from the asphalt, the more likely it is that wildlife outnumbers those on two legs. The crowdless backcountry serves as an important refuge for wildlife, but this space is shrinking amid a development boom in the Rocky Mountain west. Sholly is also concerned about the climate crisis dramatically altering habitats for wildlife, and the growing threat of exotic plants overtaking native species that support the health of animals such as elk, deer, pronghorn and bison. Fuller echoes Shollyâ€™s worries. â€œWeâ€™ve had 20 below [fahrenheit] with more frequency, but not the deep cold stretches of minus 30, minus 40, sometimes 50 below that were a defining aspect of winter here,â€<9d> Fuller says. â€œWhile weather swings are normal, the trend, overall, is in the direction of earlier spring meltoff.â€<9d> His perception is corroborated by scientific evidence. Over the last half century, the growing season (the time between the last freeze of spring and the first freeze of autumn) has increased by 30 days in the parkâ€™s valleys. Meanwhile, near Yellowstoneâ€™s north-east entrance, which has typically been colder than other parts of the park, scientists say there are 80 more days a year above freezing than in the 1960s. Such conditions mean the snowpack is melting during winter and leaving the mountains earlier in spring, which causes some rivers to run lower in late summer and drier forests, which are more susceptible to wildfire. Despite the challenges, Fuller could not imagine living anywhere else. Fuller says the park still offers important lessons to other parts of the world, including the UK. Fuller considers himself a proud anglophile. He spent one of his college years at Leeds University. A few years later, he fell in love with Angela and married her. They spent time in Uganda and raised two daughters in Yellowstone, home schooling them into their teens. With the Yellowstone ecosystem holding the distinction of having the largest concentration of mammals in the lower 48 states, lessons in how humans and wildlife can better coexist abound. Fuller shares stories of the bison that recently trudged past his window and rested in the snow near a walkway leading to his front door, and of grizzlies, including mother bears with cubs, ambling around his â€œwild neighbourhoodâ€<9d>, or seeing the aftermath of a successful wolf predation on an elk, and foxes and coyotes routinely mousing in the meadows. Fuller knows that many animals in Yellowstone can be dangerous, and he is under no false illusion about them seeking close human companionship, as one might see portrayed by Hollywood. He has never been injured, but he often gives wildlife a wide berth out of respect for their space. â€œThe older Iâ€™ve become, the more Iâ€™ve begun to appreciate the sentient connections between living things here and the places they inhabit,â€<9d> he says. â€œIn 1872, when Yellowstone was created, I donâ€™t think the US Congress could have possibly imagined how vital, as a symbol, this place would be in our time. Protecting nature for its own sake was a remarkable expression of foresight that we are only now beginning to fully understand.â€<9d> Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",FALSE,"pillar/news","News"

I was coming back from the pub one night and saw two satellites in the sky. I thought they were a great metaphor for a relationship, so when I got home I wrote down: â€œI saw two shooting stars last night / I wished on them but they were only satellites.â€<9d> When I came back to the song the following year to finish it, I realised I could truthfully open it with the line, â€œI was 21 years when I wrote this song / Iâ€™m 22 now but I wonâ€™t be for longâ€<9d>, just like Simon and Garfunkelâ€™s Leaves That Are Green. By 1980, Margaret Thatcher had been elected, the band had broken up and punk had dissipated into synthesiser groups, so A New England was my way of saying that I needed a hug as well as a new ideology. The line â€œthe girls I loved in school are already pushing pramsâ€<9d> was about my cohort. Weâ€™d all left school at 16 and were looking for different ways to become adults. As a singer-songwriter, I played electric guitar because if I had played an acoustic, the rock clubs would have sent me to the folk clubs. If audiences heckled, I could just turn it up. A New England is like a Ramones song: all bar chords on the bottom two strings. The quiet bit before the solo, where I dampen the strings with the bottom of my hand for a chugging sound, was a technique I borrowed from Thin Lizzy. Jeff Chegwin - TV presenter Keithâ€™s twin â€“ read a review of my tape in Melody Maker and gave me some studio time. He worked at music publisher Chappell and was the first person to show faith in me. When the resulting album, Lifeâ€™s a Riot With Spy vs Spy, came out, I left a copy at the BBC. That evening, Jeff and I were playing football in Hyde Park and afterwards we stood around a car listening to the radio. John Peel came on Radio 1 during Kid Jensenâ€™s slot and asked if someone could bring him a mushroom biryani before his show later. Fifteen minutes later, me and Jeff were at Broadcasting House, still in our football gear, with a mushroom biryani. I told John that Iâ€™d left a record. Later that night, I tuned in and heard him say: â€œIâ€™d have done this without the mushroom biryani.â€<9d> Then he played The Milkman of Human Kindness and I was away. A couple of years later, when Kirsty MacColl said she wanted to record A New England, she said she would need the genders changing and an extra verse. She invited me round for a fried breakfast and by the time sheâ€™d cooked it, Iâ€™d written the extra verse. Her shimmering pop version took it into the Top 10. I think itâ€™s better than mine. Oliver Hitch, producer I was the in-house engineer at Chappell, where I would record songwriters trying to sell their songs to publishers. Billy was initially booked in for a day to see how he got on. I didnâ€™t really get what he was about and waved goodbye in the corridor thinking: â€œWhat a nice bloke. Shame heâ€™ll never make it.â€<9d> Then Jeff took me to see him playing in a pub, and that made all the difference. Billy could stand on stage, make people laugh, tell a story and turn it into the introduction of the song. In those days, everything was becoming more about high production values, so to see a guy doing it raw and live with just an electric guitar was very different. I had an idea how I could record him. We recorded Lifeâ€™s a Riot in three days. We spent the first day getting a good sound using various delays and the studioâ€™s very old-fashioned plate reverb on the vocals. Once weâ€™d got that, he could run through the repertoire, do take after take and weâ€™d pick the best at the end. Billy was rough round the edges but to me, A New England, Richard and The Milkman of Human Kindness were really standout songs. A New England took a handful of takes, and not long after, Lifeâ€™s a Riot started selling in enormous quantities. I wasnâ€™t due any royalties from the record but Billy, bless him, turned up at Chappellâ€™s offices with a cheque saying: â€œI thought you deserved something.â€<9d> â€¢ A new vinyl edition of Billy Braggâ€™s recent album The Million Things That Never Happened is released on 4 February.
